      "1 : i would like to give my opinion on the 45th div. i can't see this outfit going into action. when we go out on a problem every thing seems to be going wrong sometimes i just watch some of the men. i really am afraid when we go into battle the men will be shooting their own men. no cooperation. the trouble with this outfit is there is two cliques the rebels or oklahomans and the yankees. seems as the oklahomans started the div. and are at the head of the whole thing a yank does not have a chance in this outfit to prove his ability any promotions to be given a rebel gets it not for his ability but because he is from oklahoma. and some of the non coms are really dumb. there are plenty of yankee private that should be non coms. \n",
