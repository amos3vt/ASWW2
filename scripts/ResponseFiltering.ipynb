When you see you can do a better job in another branch of service or company they won't listen to you when you ask to be changed. The meals and excersise are not properly given. The extra details are not necessary in many cases. I also can see many jewish boys still hanging around the corners in civilian life whereas their location should be in the army and the few that are in holds the best jobs.

      "My main gripe with the army is that men on special duty service or detatched service have a very poor chance for a rating. The recommendations put into your squadron may be very good and by high authority but as you don't live with the squadron they just seem to forget about your recommemdations. I know in my case I have been recommended five times for Corporal and in each case was forgotten about. My job requires me to use some authority and without a rating it sometimes becomes very hard. My officer whom I work for have tried everything for me but with no sucess. Outside of this the army has done me a lot of good and has really made a man out of me.

      " The negro situation should not be as delicate as it is sometimes made. This is especially true in the army. If the negro is a soldier, and a good one at that, we should show him the respect we give to a good white soldier. If we do not use special handling with the negro he will become a better American through being accepted by us. It will probably be proven that the negro battalion now in existence is excellent. They are used to menial jobs and will be good soldiers and tough ones. Therefore, we should use the chance to get them to work together. At the same time we can fight side by side with them and still have both races become good fighting soldiers. \n",

      "Re. #28 - My spirits are good but I'm not always satisfied here. We are supposed to have some time to ourselves every day but with fire drills, air raid drill etc. we seldom have any. There seem to be too many men always bossing me and each men has a different idea as to what should be done and when it should be done. Re #36 to #63 I am very much against Negros although a good number of them are better than many whites, therefore my answers may not be fair. Re #9 I believe some training every year would be a very good thing and should be required up to about 30 years of age. \n",

      "Despite the fact, that regardless of race-creed-or color, were all allies - colored people really seem to enjoy being together and separated from the white people because they understand each other better - and in being in separate outfits avoid confusion and have a feeling of accomplishment and a better chance for competitive achievements. \n",

      "If the Army would treat its men as real men and not as boy scouts it would make a man feel like a soldier. They waste too much time on silly and unnecessary inspections. That valuable time could be used for good training. We came here to fight and not to see whether our left shoe is where the right one should be. Good inspections are all right but not the kind we have. There have been times in this camp when the morale of the men was so low it was pitiful. \n",

A good meal smooths over a lot of rough spots & stops soldiers from complaining so much. Our meals are not so hot. Breakfast is pretty good but dinner & supper sometimes smell. You never get two good meals in a row. I have been in 3 camps & in all of them the bus service has been lousy. Some outfits do not give enough week end passes & if they do they are so short that you meet yourselve going & coming. Between a very short pass & lousy bus service a [deletion][/deletion] soldier gets disgusted. Induction centers herd you around like cattle. [deletion][/deletion] New soldiers are badly treated. Little is thought of their needs or comforts. As a soldier I got very little practice with a rifle. I fired a 22 but never a 30-30 & I am in the army 4 months.  \n",
