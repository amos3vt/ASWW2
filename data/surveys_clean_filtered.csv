0,,,"negro have been told many times they're fighting this war so that they may have democracy and the same rights and privileges as whites. but a colored soldier is more discriminated against and segregated than he was when he was a civilian. its evident to those who care to see it that not many of the promises to negro are being kept. since the emancipation proclamation negro have been fighting for what they have now. each right, each privilege was fought for. whatever conclusions may be drawn from this survey lets hope its for the further advantage of the negro. negro love america and will fight for america but the negro are going to demand a status as a citizen equal to that of a white citizen. only that way can an example of democracy be used for other countries.",black,8
1,,,i dont like the army. i had rather be on the out side i dont think i have any thing to fight for. the white have all of the privedlages and they should do the fighting,black,0
2,,,"i think that if were going to win this war, the white people in the south will have to realize that the negro soldier is taking a part in this war also, they continue to kill and lynch negro soldiers without thought that there is a war going on, and that manpower is needed badly. the white people put the colored people under the impression that they can win the war by themselves. we all know that this is foolish, because in the last war the colored soldiers were the ace in the hole",black,5
3,,,why is it that the negro dont have the the rights as the white soldier in traveling around in towns as the white when they all are just the same so far as brotherhood is consurn,black,3
4,,,"i highly approve of this questionnaire it gives me an opportunity to express my views. i firmly believe the whole cause of  is due to lack of intelligence and understanding. avoiding a problem never remedies it. we are all americans no matter what color the supreme being or nature chose to make us. a man is only a man in spirit, body, and in blood. may god grant that we all as human beings soon realize that fact. thanks again for this opportunity.",black,0
5,,,above all lets stick together and beat the axis as soon as possible so as to get back to normal living again. other problems concerning negro or whites rights should be thrashed out in congress with represen-tation of both races present.,black,2

7,,,we negro would like to go to o.c.s. but they will not give you a chance to go. i did not't know why but some of us have the edc. to go. the white officers we have from the south is hell on negro soldiers the has is to show you how to  all day on sat. to get a bus to town they are too slow. ,black,1
8,,,"i as a negro will be very surprised if at the end of this war, we are, in the south, allowed to vote for this country after we have sacrificed just as much as these whites have. i am hoping that we will be given a chance to compete with the whites if we are qualified in industrial jobs if we are qualified. i will be very glad when the day comes when a soldier in the armed forces of the u.s. are allowed whether black or not to travel in any style his finances will pay for in any part of this country. when the war ends, i want to be able to go south and to take a place in society not with but equally as high and  as any southern gentleman and not be segregated + abused by our ignorant southern whites. that we naval cadets will be judged and promoted by merit and not shades of colors. be given the same training + allowed to do the very same things as the white sailors. we are capable of handling the same situations as the whites with the same training as we are we not",black,6

12,,,think we going to win this war,black,0
13,,,"i think this questionnaire is made not complete & sufficient,- there's only one thing i have against this many & that is when we left our last camp & came to this place, it was told to us that our furloughe would follow after our six months in service was up & we would get 15 days every six months. that  about furlough has been evacuated. since we are over here in the u.s. and not over seas fighting, we should be granted the privilege of seeing our people. because if we were to go over seas, many wouldn't be fortunate to return. so he should be able to abide with his people while he's still here. after his had his training.",black,0
14,,,"i think this questionnaire was a good idea to give all the opportunity to express himself, and let the war department know what the negro thinks of the war.",black,1
15,,,the infantry is all right but it is to much walking.,black,0
16,,,"there are to much jim crowism in the army. the negro are not given a fair chance in all branches of the service. my camp doesn't have the proper vocation for negro. the white officers are more hand on negro than white. and use worse language to negro and say they don't see what what negro are fighting for it will not be any better after the war. i don't think men above thirty eight can make good soldiers. they cant take the hand treatment as younger me, but would be at more service on the homefront, and there shouldn't't be so much red tape, but discharge at once, they  cant stand up but are bitter worker than men that are much younger.",black,8
17,,,to my idea i do thank as a united  we should come to gather. i am under the same rule and regulation the white man is. and i am human the same as he i have to live just like dose. and we do as a colored race obey the law better than he dose. how would you like for the colored race. two take your mother out and hang her to a tree and beet her to death. are your wife sister brother are farther,black,2

22,,,well i only have a short one that is if i was not expose to such hard punishment to the body i would not mind it to not be in such a good health. also i would like to be near home so i could carry on the married life that was carrying on. if i had that i would not mind fighting at all but it look as though they try to make you forget about home but it impossible for me because the life i went and the job i had i made a swell life of it.,black,0

26,,,"i have been asked to give my honest + frank opinion of the army and the war, its effect for the negro. so i have done that and feel very confident that the information i have given, the true and i still rely on god and his all mighty power. personally i like the army and have  in peace time soldier. lets all hope + pray for the best, i dont think there is no man who in his heart wants to murder + kill, but this task is before us, and we must by all might try to win",black,0
27,,,i think the army is a good thing that's how I like it. but i don't like to fight. killing is not my living. army is all right if we can go home more after. i think the white and colored soldiers should mix together more often to see what each of us is doing i think they should let those men go home that no good to the army and get some young fellow that can fight to help win this war,black,0
28,,,why do they let all white drive trucks in this ser. unit and no colored. and make the colored shovel coal all the time. why is it no negro cant get a job in the motor pools. because the white soldiers are from all parts of the country and they have the feeling they are better than the negro.,black,2

31,,,"8. with a commission, yes otherwise not 30. if i had a commission i would rather be overseas 43. we shall defeat our enemies and force them to surrender, but if we consider what it has cost us in human lives and hardships we will find a somewhat hollow victory. if this war was the war that would end all wars then the victory would be complete 57. if a white solider falls, he died fighting for democracy which was his to enjoy. if a negro soldier falls, he died for the democracy he wanted to enjoy 60. if the victory can be won without us they will win it with out us. if not they will use us. ""to the victor belong the spoils"" 42 negro will be pushed out in the streets to make a living the best way they can. the white race will get all the benefits of the victory.  49. my race. when we wear the same uniform, use the same equipment that the whites do. we die the same as they do, and still don't have to the equal rights.",black,5
32,,,"45, we build this nation a mush as any race. fought in every war. never  a fight. we are true americans.",black,0
33,,,since we are fighting for the same thing we should all be trusted the way and have the same rights as everyone else should. this is our country so we should fight and pull together.,black,0
34,,,i have a good commanding officer + all lutinents are swell. i had rather be in the army then out in civilian life.,black,0
35,,,the giving of such a test is an excellent idea.,black,0
36,,,it might be a good idea to have every soldier thoroughly trained before sending him into combat. also he should be physically outfit to do the job.,black,0
37,,,the army has its good point and its bad. i think the negro should have a better chance in the army. i think a negro should be able to lead both white and color. we as negro want a double victory,black,3
38,,,"this is an interesting questionnaire, and i would like to say that if whites and negro should mix now in rxs service clubs etc when the war did end we would be better acquainted than before. and i wish to say that i don't mind dying for my country. my folks are americans and it is no reason in the world that i should resent defending them against them bastards over there. and i myself is ready to die for my country. i can think of no other country in the world i would like to have my daughter brought up with or without me.",black,0
39,,,i think this is a very goot idea getting the oppion of the soldiers an i am leaving for over sea we have all ready been arleted an i am gladde,black,0
40,,,i think this idea of having the soldier to give his opinion is a very good idea + should be asked of every one in the service. when try to do as most of them feel like should be done. as soon as the white people fine out that they are no better than the negro. then the world would be a better place to live in.,black,1
41,,,"what i think about the war and the white people treat the negro  and be treated right and stop lichying them you will win the war more sooner than will and treat the negro like humans and we will have a spirit to fight any time but we fight each other, we can't win that way i am sure.",black,3
42,,,nothing to say,black,0
43,,,"it is obvious that you know you are questioning colored soldiers. so if you ask them for their frank opinions. why not take them into consideration and give him the breaks and other privileges that help to make a soldier fight harder for the things you say we are fighting for and not treat us as if we were not wanted. i am expressing my opinion and i know that same sentiment is carried by most of the men in my outfit. this obvious that you know you are questioning colored soldiers so if you ask them for their frank opinions, they you take them into consideration and give then the breaks and other privileges that help to make a soldier fight harder for the things you pay we are fighting for and treat us as if we are not wanted....",black,1
44,,,a colored soldier will never get the equal breaks a white soldier gets. a white soldier gets more privileges than a colored soldier.,black,4
45,,,the way the negro is treated  with the section of the country. it is much better in the north with northern officers. i had rather have negro officer with same power as white but usually they must take order from whites who is in most cases the highest ranking officer. we should give our lives for this country but we should also insist that we be treated as any other american after the war.,black,2
46,,,"my battery commander is a very strict man that doesn't care much for colored people, and he will not give ratings as he should, i believe if i have ability to do certain things and is a good soldier i deserve a rating of some kind. thank you a soldier of the u.s. army",black,0
47,,,thank you,black,0
48,,,"q(44) i think that the rights of the negro will be the same or even worse after the war. in miss. there are lynchers, also lynch leader who are wearing state polices buttons, the law in miss its self are with the lynchers. i was reading an article in the paper today. there was a colored soldier and col. woman in a cafe passing licks (blows) a law saw them came in there and began to beat the col. soldier on the head with a his blackjack. another white man was passing in a truck saw it stops, came in with a iron bar and began beating the soldier. the law was standing watching the soldier's blood drop on the street and wouldn't attemp to do anything. sir, i hope i live to see col. people be given equal throughout the u.s.",black,2
49,,,for it very hard to get white and negro to stay together without fighting,black,2

51,,,i would like to all negro lieutenant i believe whilewill be treated better,black,1
52,,,i don't know whether i made myself clear or not but the main thing i'm trying to say is as long as you have (jim crow) in the u.s. you will not have a very good negro soldier. but if you throw that out (and the people in the white house can do it if they want to) you would have some of the best fighting soldiers ever stood up in a pair of g.i. shoes. and if you don't believe it just give them that chance and see for yourself.,black,2
53,,,know othere comments i has to say,black,0
54,,,"the only thing i'm waiting for is duration and 6 months. this survey is a good thing, but as usual any thing concerning a negro is never looked into as it should- so this seems like a waste of time.  every thing i said is my opinion only if i could come true i might like the army",black,1
55,,,i don't have any more to say,black,0
56,,,(part 77) there should be no difference how a man is arranged white or colored everyone has to fight an if its necessary for both to fight there should be no prejudice on either side.,black,2
57,,,i don't have any trouble with any body we all seem to be willin to do what lever we can where lever we can,black,0
58,,,our battery commander do not like colored soldiers he is from the south and have southern ways he do not like to see us have any recreation at all i believe a colored officer no how we all feel and would lie us a chance to live and let live speaking for a whole we don't think much of our battery commander i would like a colored superior officer not on the white man i would give my life for the commander in chief any day for the support of my family,black,6
59,,,"some of the questions in this questionnaire, should have had why in some of the questions, kind of unfair and hard to answer.",black,0
60,,,"a very thoughtful questionnary hope my thoughts can help win the war there, as well as help solve the racial problem here, thanks.",black,1
61,,,"what have the colored people got to fight for? there a flag but it belong to the white people. everything the colored people got it come from the white people. what they say goes, it nothing can be done about it. just for an example (lynching)",black,4
62,,,i don't think white and colored soldiers should have the same p.x. or  and that way it won't be no misunderstanding between them if white soldier from the south see you call with one is lady he would want to fight,black,3
63,,,"you will notice throughout this questionnaire that i am opposed to segregation not that i personally care to associate with whites but only to give the masses of both groups a chance to mingle freely with one another and thereby learn that there are good & bad in both groups. also that when given the same opportunity negro are as capable as whites. in our outfit some of the officers seem to feel that  negro haven't the ability & the stamina necessary to become officers, yet there are many instances where negro officers have proved there merit. i feel that being a negro soldier & valuing my life as much as any white & having to take the same chances in battle i should be allowed all the rights & privileges & opportunities that are given white soldiers, and that negro civilians should have same opportunities as white civilians.",black,8
64,,,i hope some of the questions in here will come out all-right.,black,0
65,,,when do you thank the wore whil over in 5 year or ten year. will the 3 diving have to go over or not,black,0
66,,,"i think this questionnaire is absolutely unfair; these questions that have been asked are the same old conditions that has confronted the negro and is common knowledge. the results of such, we all know are nil. since any of these conditions stated could and would have been at least partially solved by introducing them and inforcing them. the conditions under which the negro soldier is laboring not only corroborates the fact that he is doing more than his share, but makes him stand out as a superhuman. funny, the potential strength of this nation could exceed itself by such a margin, if ? a house divided cannot stand and will not stand. i dare say the economic, political and social status of this nation would be greatly affect by this recognition. are we really feared? i can only see that given the opportunity we rightful deserve it would make us the strongest nation in its world and serve as a true beacon light - democracy to my mind is the best form of government that we know to date but it must be a true democracy regardless of race, color or creed",black,3
67,,,"i am a soldier in the u.s. army; my outfit is stationed at camp atterbury, indiana. i do particularly notice that when negro soldiers go to the city (indianapolis), they are segregated; they are not allowed in so called withe theaters, or public restaurants; for such enjoyments as these, they are isolated in their own colored sections. we are all fighting for the same cause, and should enjoy the same privileges the country affords; but it is not so, and the sooner something is done about such situations, the more likely it will be that negro and whites will get along. do something about lynching; why they are even lynching soldiers, and still they expect them to fight and die for those by whom they are being lynched. let us all be really democratic.",black,4
68,,,after this war hope negro get better treatment than before. and when the negro soldier come home get good job. and we will have the right live where we get.,black,1
69,,,"i realize this questionnaire is to get the reaction of the negro soldier towards the government, the civilians, and how he feels towards other countries. i have only this to say that if the negro both now as a soldier and later as a civilian is given anywhere a near break he will be an asset to his country.  in other words treat him in all parts of the country and jobs or positions as equally as the white race it will be to the credit of the white race.",black,4
70,,,i have answered all questions to the best of my knowledge and i haven't any comments,black,0
71,,,we should have more negro office. we should have some office over a company that understand men. we should have an old office over our company. this camp is no where for a negro soldier to be we could have better bus service to here. we would like to have a negro company commado. the army said they would give you the job you are best outfit for but you cannot in this outfit. they will not even talk about it. i would like to be in phila q m tailoring or truck @ m. b. n. i am best outfit for that kind of work to help the war.,black,1
72,,,i don't think that it should make any difence between the human race the negro are as good as the and the white are the same tea ll are fighting for the same causes negro should be treated the same  as there   negro soldier are treated very  from the north  neather have i argud officers then write  from the negro  be treated but  should be treated like white peaples after all  at stake as will at the white man that is my idea,black,7
73,,,"to speak very frank both races are fighting for the same purpose. i can't see any reason why there should be any prejudice at all. all are human being's. a colored mans life means just as much to him as a white's. a negro soldier thinks just as much of his families as a white. that's one reason why this country has so many difficulties, they have a war within the united states. i can't understand why some of our distinguished leaders don't wake up and realize that ""all men are created equal,"" and should be treated likewise.",black,4
74,,,well we dont to fight. but we have to fight and we work hard to fight. i would like to be in all negro outfit and no white at all we like and we cant i due to part well i don't like the army at all,black,0

77,,,i have none except the negro should have their right an privileges to work where they want to - color should mean nothing.,black,2
78,,,the policy of separation as practiced in army and army camps make it seem to negro that they are in service for white people instead of serving along with them.,black,2
79,,,the colored man in the u.s. does not have a fair chance if the negro have hell at home and then have to go and fight he does not feel like making a good soldier he feels like he does not have anything to fight. when the negro is given a fair chance he will make a better man or soldier. when he feels that he has something to live for he will not mind dying for it. until the day comes that the white man does not look at the negro as a negro but as one of them and the negro does like wise that the day that the negro will feel that he has something to live for and he will not mind dying because he feels he has something to die for.,black,3
80,,,"i think it is fine, i hope it will work out some of the irrigularities in mood of the camps where negro soldiers are trained under white officers. i say this without any prejudice on my part.",black,0
81,,,i thought the questions were very good,black,0
82,,,some are from some the south and they like to treat a negro like they do down south in the army. therefore that will not work in the army.,black,1
83,,,the sooner the white people and colored people will get togeter and stop the gruge that has been since slavery time the better the 2 races will get along; then i don't thank there will be so many wars. i think you,black,0
84,,,"i only hope that this country will be as interested in freedom for its own different races, as it is in freedom for other races in foreign countries. guarantee freedom at home first then be an example for other people of the world.",black,0
85,,,"i think that since there is so much racial prejudice and hatred going on the negro soldier tends to feel as though he is just being """"used"""" by the white people as we have been in the past.  we are treated like """"hell"""" all of the time and when a war breaks out we are given a few privileges to build up our patriotism and we have to fight for """"our"""" country. even though deep down inside of every one of us we know that we are not fighting for a democracy that is equally beneficial to the negro as the other race.  we are all wondering that after the war will we still be barred from hotels, theaters, etc. segregated in trains and horses -- lynched in the south -- given lowly jobs that white doesn't want etc. and yet we have fought and given lives for this country. i doubt if there will ever be a true democracy here. it would be better if there were a law made that the u.s. majority of whites do not want negro around.",black,2
86,,,"some of these questions were rather difficult for me, because my idea of the army was some what different than i found. we have some good sergeant and officers.  we also have some that is going to cause some trouble sooner or later. although i believe the boys in my outfit are well behaved as any. one or two sergants + officers carries things a little to far at times.

87,,,as a whole the negro will be more united after the war due to his training and cooperation with other soldiers and will have spirit to speak for and demand his rights.,black,1
88,,,i am glad to have a chance to express myself and get a chance to answer question which are very good question but i might have never thought of this hadn't i been given this chance so i am very much glade to get this chance so with my kindness i am thankful for the oportunity of expressing my mind.,black,0
89,,,to make better jobs along,black,0
90,,,advancement after a colored soldier has become a 2nd lieutenants seems very slow so i indifferent as to were i become an officer or not. i notice that negro soldiers with ability from 184th f.a. become officers of all rank from colonel down because the outfit was all colored. that is the only way possible for a young negro with ability to advanced. why should there be white senior officers of 100% negro enlisted personal and not even junior negro officers over white enlisted personal. i can't understand unless white man is consider more efficient to himself and places himself upon a throne even in the army of the u.s. the station hospital here has a table for negro to go over in the back of the mess and eat when there are white southern soldiers there who can't write their name of speak a word of english. the situation is inendible.,black,11
91,,,let us first after the war do: no segregation of any kind equal education substantial financial aid for all americans create jobs for all soldiers do away with old customs and values that are against the freedom of all americans give god a little more attention he is the answer to this questionnaire.,black,0
92,,,"i think the questionnaire was a very good idea. it give us a chance to express ourselves. in the american white knowing our opinion, i believe it will serve as an aide to we negro. also, about the transportation, i am afraid to leave camp sometimes because of the fact the bus may run late and i return a.w.o.>. what we need are more  or truck service.",black,0

104,,,"why i would like to be stationed in the north is because i don't mind being in the army, and i don't mind giving my life for my country, so therefore the country must have some consideration for a man especially a married man. you see when a man is a long ways from home he can sit down and think a lot of things. i have a daughter at home in which i've never seen before. in another case, if you are from home and go into town get some kind of device you have lost that time alright if that man was stationed near home he can go home an come back just like he left he for, because he knows whats home. now my daughter was born two weeks after i came in the army i have not saw her yet, now things like that can really hurt a man i think thats the reason why you have so many a.w.o.l. in the army. he can be able to go home at least once a month and at least seven days out a month. he doesn't have to married officially to go home an see his mother or his family.",black,0

462,,,"in general the questionnaire is o.k. but i am different from most people i don't agree with everyone i see so dont misinterpret me i am in this army and i am going to fight for this country and soon i think, but down in my heart i know a white man hates me and only wants to use me in an emergency well that o.k. but you all dont want us here why dont you send us away or colonize? the negro there  we wouldn't interfer with your women, or they wouldn't bother us. if you want to win this war and i know you so, if you would start cleaning up at home first and start freeing europe later on maybe things would progress better as for me i dont give a damn because i dont expect to come back after the war anyhow.",black,2
463,,,i believe that the to two races should be brought closer together in the army than they are at present. most of the race trouble occurs because we do not understand each other. the negro and white soldier i think could serve in the same unit if they had the opportunity.i have never had any trouble with a white soldier!,black,1

465,,,one in the same form should be given the (white) so both sides can be weighed enough was not asked about the officers & treatment of the men & conditions & army routine. this type of work should be carried on verbally when possible. i'm taking & getting the same things in the army now that i'm susposed to be fight ‚äì the enemy for taking away and to get some of them that i'm not getting the government should be doing some thing about the lynchings and killings of the colored soldiers since the war. federal civil & state rights should be enforced to the fullest extent of the law for every indvidual regardless of race creed or color the anti-lynch law should be passed and enforced. radicalism among (whites) should be checked in all agencies where the negro is concerned in answering this i hold no prejudice opinions. i want the chance and rights that belong to me and don't wan't to fight for them i'm a free human being in a civilized nation thats supposed to stand for these things),black,1
466,,,"this questionnaire is a nice step forward but as a race we have been fooled so many times i hesitate to place any faith in what will be done. when the final report reaches your hand i will have to see with my own eyes and also experience the change. something will have to be done and talk will not do it, action only. speaking as a young negro i, myself don't want to socolize with the whites, i only want to live and raise my family to be educated in the ""real principles"" this country of ours stand for.",black,2
467,,,some of our white lieutenants in my particular outfit should stop cussing the soldiers out and have more patience with them. some of our noncom officers do not assume the right attitude towards the men under their charge. - if you want a soldier to do his best i believe you can get whatever you want accomplished without abusing him in any way or using profane language. if you want to discipline a soldier talk to him in the right way and treat him as a man and you'll always have a nice outfit.,black,1
468,,,"i've heard many times since entering the army that an army unit is like a foot ball team. we all work together to accomplish an objective. i've seen many foot ball teams and i've played basket ball myself and i do know that when a few members of the team think that they are better in skill or in any way, you don't have much cooperation. a few try to gain all of the honors. in the fight to win, the ups and downs in every fight tends to unit the time and bring them closer together. thus forming a one for all and all for on compact. if i can't play with my friend, why should i help him fight when he has an arguement. morale is important in the army away from home from your loved ones, but the army camps in the south are lacking for negro and some of the border line camps are not bad. absence v.s.o. shows; segregation in army theaters, no transportation, no service club for the five or six different colored unites and two scantly supplied px for the same amount.",black,1
469,,,"1. before i entered the army, i worked for and held a fairly important job in a defense plant; i have spent 8 months in the army doing exactly nothing and learning nothing . using a pick and shovel. 2. i felt more loyalty to the country before i entered the army. now i don't feel any loyalty after seeing the condition in the south. 3. why should we get white southern officers that hate negro. 4. n.c.o.'s are selected in our co. by their friends instead of ability. i don't understand how the army expect us to follow a n.c.o. that does not know what he is doing and some can not even read or write. 5. the negro has not a thing to fight for. 6. the negro soldier has  no recreation. 7. negro soldier should never be placed in the south. 8. we should have all negro officers. 9. negro are usually placed in labor battalions. 10. white civilians in the south hate negro soldiers and the negro soldier hates them.",black,8
470,,,"the whole army and navy or the armed forces seem to be based upon segregation. they draft the negro but his presence's not wanted. in most of the southern country his treatment is very bad. the bus service is bad. he is forced to sit in the back, most of the time he has to stand up. when in town - every one stares at him - when he enters a restaurant or anywhere for that matter. if there's any trouble he's always to blame regardless. because of such treatment, the negro soldier has an attitude of hate toward his fellow americans - especially in the southern states.",black,3
471,,,i like a white man as well as i do a colored man if he is a intelligent person. its time now that both races get together and live and try to win this war so we can all go home. buckle down and really pull together and stop all this ignorant segregation in the south. the colored soldier would and could do much better if he was treated like a soldier and not a dog. we love american just as any other race but how can we love it when people act like we are beast. it has been proven that if a colored person try hard enough to do something great he can do it. but first the spirit must be there + not a lot of hatred.,black,3
472,,,the jim crowing of the south should be stopped at once and therefore the united states would be so much better as a whole. the conditions for the colored soldier in the south are damn louzy but for the white boys it is very nice i have been in both the u.s.o. and find the negro are dumps but the whites are very fine not any certain service club or u.s.o. but as a whole a lot in general find they the same way which could be changed if the high officials would only act on the whole situation but they don't care how a colored soldier is treated.,black,7
473,,,"i think colored and white commishoned officers should live eat & work together color should not make any difference no places especially in the army. southern white officers should be taught how to treat a soldier when very sick in hospital. negro that wear the uniform of the unites states army should not be molested by southern whites that is if the uniform mean any thing. conditions in the south should be made better for the negro soldier they should be made just as good as the whites...such as usa services clubs, restaurants, bus transportation in fact all kinds f transportation the army fighting men should be as one then things would be better",black,9
474,,,bus transportation is very poor here in the south. you are pushed in the back just have a few seats and then they crows you of of your seats but dont want youto sit up front. same thing on the part in theaters. at home things are bad. my wife has a child. she can't get out to work the alottment she gets doesn't take care of her like i did not when i was home so that makes things a lot worse with our wives left at home. as for an nefroes are concerned things will always be the same thats my opinion for the way they are treated while in service shows that they are not much thought of that is in tsouthern states i have been in since in service. so when the was is over we will have to do the best we can toward getting jobs and such.,black,0
475,,,i wish the war was over now because i could have a lots better out of the army than in,black,0
476,,,the u.s. government should use that after this war that every body is given a fair chance to make a living aegan and less of race creed or color. foreign governments know that there is a difference made between white and colored that is one reason our country was attacked by japan.,black,1
477,,,"our outfit was the first bn on this post proper and we have helped build and seen this camp grow. race feelings are not so bad on the post, because soldiers are here from all sections. i have seen white soldiers on the buses who went out of the way to be friendly to colored soldiers. i have seen colored soldiers unfair to whites & vice versa, but those are exceptions and both should be forced to have a better understanding. ignorane is a dangerous thing. my solution would be education, which can be accomplished by having mixed px service clubs and so on under supervision. if we are good enough to die together then why not eat together. ther is absolutely not enough recreational activities on this post for negro under this set up 4000 or 5000 soldiers to be served in one small service club and two small px. do away with the jim crow laws especially in the posts.",black,6

482,,,i think  should be made on what you know instead of who you know. it would raise the morale of the negro soldier if the px and service club were better. i think a soldier should be placed in the branch of service in which he is best qualified. i'm 23 years old. most men in my outfit are 35. the average age is 35.,black,1

488,,,"i am trying to be broadminded about the whole matter as possible, and with a cosmopolitan outlook, my honest opinion is: the soldier's attitude or morale is determined largely by how he is being treated by his superiors primarily, and then in the immediate vicinity of the places he is exposed to. very discouraging in the outfit i'm in, (and i can only speak for this particular outfit) that ability, intelligence and leadership doesn't mean a man's advancement in the army, but your ability to get in the ""syndicate"" or ""clique"", how good you stand in with the man over you, the man who can ""look out"" for you. this is the most saddening thing i've found  my company. and apparently the company or battalion commander display concern to these proceedures. i don't know exactly when to blame the soldier himself, the non. coms or the commanders frankly speaking, i feel that my company commander is responsible for the dissatisfaction that exist with with almost everyone in my company. i've  under the assumption that a man in this positions responsibilities are to try to to helpful, to encourage the men, promote good will and confidence among them, help them with the negative disposition. i came in the army to be a good soldier, and do what i could to win the war, my intentions and hopes were high, but now i'm being disillusioned more day by day. it's hard to go on being a good soldier and keeping your word good under these circumstances, much as one wants to. there are many more minor conditions that aren't good, but to me this is the primary and most important one. i don't expect to much from the army, i can adjust myself to almost any condition that isn't unbearable, but i can't seem to feel satisfied in  this particular outfit. and i have really tried to this is just a personal viewpoint, and i imagine similar conditions exist in other outfits, but i can only speak for this one.",black,0

492,,,"there are hundred of things i should mention but space will not allow me to. the camp where i am now, the transportation are very poor for the number of troups stationed here. sure i have been to better camps and all are different. i sometime wonder how does the white ordinary soldier think of the colored solidier. you can easy tell the part of the country where the white soldier come, because the treatment are different. the colored man's blook are just as red as the white man, and i dont see any reason why the white man think that he is ?earer than the colored man. after this war i am sure the colored man will not put up with all this 3.6.9. that he has been confronted with in the years of the past. the law making body generally disregard the constitution of the united states when it come to when a negro is envolved. to whom it may concern you your self dont think the colored man is given an equal break, if you are thinking ",black,10
493,,,the negro should have an equal break in all things in this country. negro non-coms should have more privileges - should get more passes etc. negro civilians in southern states should be treated better than they are treated now.,black,0
494,,,first of all i pity the poor negro soldier returning to the south after a sojourn in the north. his views + personal contacts will have broadened while his field will not have changed and that will result only in disastrous friction. there should be enacted federal laws with teeth in them (and enforced) whereby negro be given at least a fighting chance without danger of lynching + maltreatment merely because his face is black.  educational facilities + possibilities should be demanded + given  everyone.  whether it is fight--play--or work give us a chance to prove that our hearts are as big as yours + our blood just as red. except in the major leagues of baseball they're doing it very successfully in the north + the results are amazing. in the west more and more people are establishing social contacts because they have discovered that negro are very amiable when given the chance.  give us economic equality  + the social naturally fall in line.,black,0
495,,,"in my estimation, the colored soldier has'n't a chance down south. he is treated like an animal. you may think i'm to young to understand, but i know. my father died when i was 5. i don't even remember him. but mother tells me what he won't . my father was in the british army. thats why i say, what has the negro got to fight for? can you answer that. many have given their lives to  to big the world of , but what does the white man think? i'll tell you, he thinks the colored race is the terriblest thing there ever was. yes they speak of free speech etc, but anyone can speak, what are they going to do about it? not a thing (ever) you asked me my conseption of this there it is. only god knows what will happen after this war. so i say again what has the colored soldier to fight for. many have families to worry about, and are taken from their homes, well they put him some place on the map where he has to be tormented,then when he gets in a fight, they want to get rid of him. again i say what have we to fight for. onlt god knows what the morrow will bring. i may be a volunteer, but if i ever get out ----.",black,4

497,,,"everyone to their likeness, but when in service, we are told that officers pass their judgment ours is passed over. i would like very much to come north, although i have gained much experience while traveling from place to place. in civilian life, i drove automobiles and trucks of all kinds, also had some mechanical instructions, this is why i'd prefer ordanance. the colored soldier from the north suffers greatly in the south, and some suffering comes to southern soldier in the north but he fins he doesn't have to (uncle tom) everyone he meets while there. he may suffer when he returns to civilian life back home. it is my opinion the colored race will be given more opportunity if they group now. this is my firm hope and i hope and pray for the time to come soon, when we will be as a peaceful loving nation allover this hemisphere.",black,3
498,,,"in most of my time in the army we spent in the south, and the things that has happen to us colored soldiers down here it would surprise me if before long we have a war right here including the one on the other side. southern officers are no good for northern colored troops, they train you as if you are their slaves instead of their soldiers. myself i've been gassing off about this for so long as one of them i say, do something or we will. to fight for the country you love it must in turn love you.",black,4
499,,,in this branch of service i just try to study out why all of our command officers are from the south. we keep a north officer only a short while. the condition of colored soldiers on many of the post i have been on is poor. i can recall one post that stood out that is jackson s.c. where we was there only a few weeks. our colored officers had to demand salutes from white soldiers. i sometime wonder is this what the army calls getting along with you fellow man.,black,2
500,,,well about this food the army  as long as i been in the army i never before i came here where they separated white and color flour. i saw that out of my own eyes a sign white boys flour and i am damn sure that you can see where their use a different they have a post exchange right in our company and we cant ever buy a pack of cigaretts have to go about 1/2 of a mile to get some. white and all wearing the same uniform fighting fore the same thing pay the same price. some time can ride a bus when do have to stand up or go in the back dont have to raise some hell or fight so you should see it as i does that all.,black,2
501,,,the negro soldier should be placed in camps situated in their part of the country mainly because they are use to the customs of that part of the country. if the army officials keep sending northern soldiers south there will always be that bitter feeling between the two colored northerners and white southerners. more time is usually diverted to how we are treated than to our regular work and what we are in the army for. much more cooperation could be obtained from colored northern soldiers if they were stationed somewhere in the north instead of the south. another fault is the use of southern white officers over a group of northern colored soldiers. they usually don't understand our emotions and never think that we have the same will power and brain power as they. they think we are not capable of being officers and treat our colored second lieutenants thus. many white officers of the same grade have come to our outfit during the same time as colored officers. they are now first lieutenants and don't know as much in most cases as the colored officers. is that equality? especially so evident in a colored outfit. everyone has noticed it.,black,11
502,,,"i think that if colored troops were given a chance to prove that they were as efficient as the whites they would come through with flying colors. but why should we be treated in some places as dogs and why should we have to give up our lives fighting for things that are of benefit to white only in most instance. when the bullets are flying they don't give a damn whether you're white, black or yellow when they hit you you die, or bleed, ""red"" blood all of us. not as perhaps some might think we might bleed black blood or something. so why not cut this damn thing out and fight and win this war. ""lincoln"" said, ""that all men are created equal"". suppose we were on the battle-field and because of some this stuff wouldn't help out our white friend because in our heart we could see through a day a train station one side a nice cozy waiting room u.s.o. and really a fine place but a 20 yrd. distance from that finery was a place not outfit for a dog to enter - ""colored"" wrote in large letters. but still we have the same uniform and fight and die. for equal rights & democracy.",black,8
503,,,"negro soldiers should be removed from the south up north where the people at least act civilized. you could be a better soldier where peoples dont stare and laugh at you as if you were poison. i have often heard about the treatment negro get in the south but dueing to fact that we are soldiers and all may have to die for that same civilian who insists on insulting you. it is high time that we all should wake up and forget those things. we are at war with our enemies and we cannot win a war over there if we cannot conquer the south over here. the north is just a little bit better but not much. i have lived in the north for twenty years and this is my first time ever being in the south and i do hope after the war it will be my last, if i am still around.",black,1
504,,," we as a whole do not like the commanding officer of this outfit. i think we would be much better off with anther commanding officer because this mans rotten an instead making friend he is making enemies. when i cam to the service i was a volunteer but i have wished a thousand times i had waiting until i was called. the army as a whole is all right but the people who runs the army ain't? worth a good god damn including all the high official. the people of america sometime i think it would be better for some other nation to take over. if it was left for me to do, i wouldn't be here until ",black,0
505,,,i think if the negro and whites had more dealing with each other it would be better for some i am quite sure because there are a lot of whites that think negro are not human and uncivilized which forces me to think they are uncivilized they even get angry at the sight of a negro in uniform and seems to think all negro soldiers should be in the infantry i feel that most negro soldiers would be better off overseas than stationed in a southern army corp because a negro has enemies both places but when overseas he is armed therefore he would have a better chance of being protected,black,9
506,,,"as a soldier in the armed forces i think that every soldier should be made to feel that he is the best damn soldier in the world. the army should protect all of its soldiers and see to it that they aren't mistreated. they should be given a chance according to there abilities regardless to color. when a soldier is made to feel he is inferior he lacks the efficcancy to perform his task which he should have.  there is a reluctance on the part of the officials of the war dept to allow certain soldiers (negro) to get much of a chance in the air corps & other units. there are only a few tanks units (two). its not because these soldiers aren't proficient in these branches. its a false conception on the part of the higher ups. men should be graded by character and ability and place accordingly. and not held and restricted mostly to certain units. to me the average white soldier (enlisted) man is prejudiced, because he knows we are all got to cooperated in order to bring this war to a successful conclusion. the false theory that white and negro soldiers can't get along to-gather is absolutely false. in certain places they have prooven it such. it can be done everywhere else. i don't mind going over seas to help smack the axis and help make the world safe for democracy but i certainly would like to see certain places in this country made safe for certain minorities. the whites especially from the south are very unwilling to give every citizen a chance to work and fight as they desire. what is a  handicap to people who are absolutely patriotic, and willing to sacrifice as everyone else does. its bad on the morale of the negro american soldier.",black,8
507,,,"give the negro a brake to show what he can do to help his country in this war if you go all out for the white soldiers why not go all out for the negro in giving him a brake don't keep saying this is the land of the free and only mean it for the whites don't forget that the lord put white, colored, yellow etc on this good earth and that we are all to be the same no matter what are color may be think it over remember the negro from the north is not going to be kicked around after this war is over like he was in the last war remember before the war and draft the negro was just a forgotten race but just when war started everyone in washington jumps up and says lets all good americans lets to to war and then he called the negro a american a year before that a man in washington got up in the house and try to pass a bill to send all the negro as he put it back to africa where they belong, how do you like that",black,10
508,,,not that i fear that it will ever happen but the sooner the american white population acknowledge that we (negro) too are a part of this vast wheel of machinery the better off this country will be don't say we are fighting for one thing and all the time there are places here where one is treated like a enemy. even the japanese here in this country can get more and go further than the negro. and dont mention the german. any way none of this race (negro) has been shoot for sabatorge.,black,4
509,,,"the most irritating part to me about the army training i have received is this: since leaving induction center i have been continuously moved deeper and deeper into the heart of the south and conditions and the attitudes of the people also have been growing worse. it is impossible to understand how the brains of the southern white man works and just what can be the cause of so much enmity and hate that is imposed upon the negro soldier. with all the patriotic speeches and supposedly war effort he takes time out to heap insults and abuse upon the negro soldier who is doing all that he can to further the war effort. this energy could be well used to further the defeat of the enemy. to my mind most southern white people must fear that the rise of the negro will be of danger to their long vaunted white supremacy. there can be no other reason for such stupid treatment of a fellow american. stupidity as we all know breeds ""fear"". (over) this unrest among the forces of the united states can in the long run be a leading factor to the lengthening of this war. for as the saying goes a house or an army divided against itself will surely fall, hitler knows this better than we may think. in my mind, judging from the average opinion of most of the negro soldiers that i have met; it would be of great value if they were trained in a more friendly environment. a soldier can not devote his entire mind and body to the very necessary training under such adverse conditions as we in the south are forced to undergo.",black,6

693,,,"both white and negro soldiers will not be made better from a racial point of view unless democracy be given a chance in uniting the might of its peoples. democracy is fouded on religious principles, then the nation as a whole will prosper spiritually, financially, morally, racially, etc. in proportion as we let democracy all problematic situations as they arise.",black,2
694,,,"in my outfit the men are mostly from the south. our company commander seems to favor the yes man or uncle tom type of negro for n.c.o.s, rather than those who seem fairly intelligent and show an aptitude in grasping the subjects taught to them. we have had it stressed to us that combat engineers are a bit more intelligent than most other units in the army.  from the way the lectures and critiques are broken down in a kindergarten form i am inclined to disagree with that theory. glaring examples of this mistaken belief can be seen around here any day.",black,0
695,,,i think that the army has a good idea for younger men in the service than men over 38 because they are more active and can catch on things easier an more outfit in health. the older men can carry on the war industry work. i don't think that they should call in married men with wife and children until they see a good cause and have nothing else to turn to.,black,0
696,,,the following questionnaire is answer to the best of my knowledge in which to help win this war but it won't be won if they dont to stick by one anther and treat each other as a brother. a war can be won by but i don't believe in separating the soldiers from each other as they are in there to win a victory so the people can have a better place to live. but i don't mean to let the germanys and japs win it because we don't want them to win. and if we all get together like a one happy family we wipe them off the map and i know we will do it.,black,0
697,,,i dont believe it should make any different as to weathe a soldier is white are negro i believe the u.s. army uniform should be respected. i know it is unfair to negro soldiers to refuse ????? them service as so many resturants in some of the towns i have been since i have been in the army. these are the only thing that ever make me feel low down in spirit it's when i have money hungry and in a place where there is places to buy food yet because i am a negro my money is no good. i do hope and trust that the things will be changed i am doing my part as a soildier and i hope you will consider the rascial problems of negro,black,4
698,,,"i think along the line of the army, that every soldier is working for the same thing and that is to win the war. and the only way we will do it is to work together.",black,0
699,,,we are in a separate outfit thats probably why they don't have separate px and service clubs. i often wonder what will be my reward for fighting in this war. my enthusiasm is not as high as the white boys. they have more to loose or gain. i was refused room in a white hotel when i went to the induction station in los angeles. that did not give me much courage to want to fight. if i thought the white people would give the colored people living a square deal i would gladly die for the cause. but i know they will not. still i think we should iron all that out after the war is over. we have a battle to win. it comes first. i am one who wrote to secretary stimeon about that,black,2

706,,,i think we should at least have 15 days every six months to go home.  eight month i have not been home. why was negro sent south to the training most all the marching negro are sent far south. i think if we were training in our own states  the east  midd west we all would be much better soldier the we are now in the south it is n place for us to go or  in my state there is always places for negro soldier to have fun an the walking  doing a hard week work.,black,1
707,,,id like to express my personal opinion about the unfairness of any number of non coms as well as commissioned officers in this camp. i think a person should rate what he is. a lot of our non coms could be taught by some of the boys they are teaching. i think b.c. should know every man and his ability ‚äì and not take the sergeants word or any one else. every body should be given a fair chance in order to prove their ability. if a soldier discovers that he can do a better job in some other branch he should be granted the privlidge to prove it. every non comm should prove that he knows more about the ‚äì that he is in than any one in his platoon to be the leader of it.,black,0
708,,,"i think after a man have been in the army six month's, he should be able to obtain a furlough, and the negro soldier's in the south should be treated better. the colored officer's are stops at a certain point, and there are no colored btry. commander's in our div.  out here in fort huachuca, the soldier's do not have any social life, and i think after serving five or six month's he should be moved to another camp, i don't under stand why they take the boy's from the north an send them to the south. i think if a soldier was closer to home he would be a better soldier. i under stand there is a man power shortage, why dont the government send the men who were working in a defense plant back especially the married one's. and i think now is the time for the negro to be given his equal right's, it would bring up his morale, because at the present he have to little privilege's to fight for. above all i wish the white would stop this lynching in the south.",black,5

720,,,i would not mind being in the army if things were better then it is now. as it is now all feels like hell because the way they drive and make the soldiers do their jobs every day in the week not giving us much time for pleasure which isn't much in this camp when we have a pass we have a very few places to go close to camp all other places are fifty miles away which also makes it hard for the soldiers. then when we do go to these towns there are a very few places that we can go. being so far away from home they should treat all the same white or negro. the food should be more plentiful and better cooked. they should let a soldier go home when it is possible that we can be a better soldier than we are now after knowing things at home are ok and to see the ones we love. the negro camps would be a lot better if there were all colored officers.,black,2

729,,,the company that i am in have very poor non- comminsied offiecs only the very poor and digradted get ratings. something should be down about this. our company commander is a very poor leader ; he does not care how his men are getting along. in my company the commander is white and the other officers are negro but this have only been for a few weeks. the negro make very good combat soldiers if they had good leaders. leaders that arent as vain and thinks he is so much better than a private ,black,1
730,,,if the 93 division is to be an all colored division why should we have white leaders after all the negro make the best soldiers but the white officers  to much out of the men. if a soldier is going to be trained for combat  is to give his life for his country why could  he be  enough home to see his people ,black,1
731,,,"if the negro soldier is good enough to participate in the tough & rough army to help our country why not have privileges as same as the white man. since we are considered rotten & no good, we shouldn't't have to fight. we realize this is a white man's country but we are willing to fight for it because we live in it. therefore after this war i hope every negro will take this matter into consideration and force less segregation & a fair living as white people have. if all negro were like me things would be a hell of a lot better  site worse. we must show the white man we are all men together before we shall have equal rights. a man is a man no matter what race, creed or color, so why not be treated alike.",black,8

733,,,there are quite a few changes that have got to be recognized by the white man before the u.s. can have complete success with this war. the white man for a great many years the white man has belittled every race of color. the japs are a race of color that has and is resenting this type of treatment by the white man and the japs are will to fight till death to show the white races that they are just as smart and even braver than the white race.  the japs had no other reason to strike at pearl harbor the way they did other than to show the american white man he isn't the smartest thing under the sun. i could say more but i won't in fact all i will say sleep on fool white man and some day you are going to find your very ass in hell right where you have tried to keep all other races of color. sleep on fools sleep on but some day you will awake too late and wish you hadn't been such a fool. wake up white man and allow these races of color a chance. otherwise sleep on -- fools -- by a black ,black,11

757,,,all i want is to go home to hell with the whole damn thing. i don't see why i was ever taken in the army. a negro life is worth damn when they get through with him. so all i want is to go home & have some  in a decent bed. i never did like sleeping on the ground any way.,black,0

760,,,i think that if the negro where to get more chance to fight and thereby get some recognition besides that of a laborer it would go a long way to strengthen his position as a citizen after the war. after all what is not worth having is not worth fighting for. we want to fight so that we can say we had some fighting part in winning the war for our country,black,0

762,,,"i think that the white soldier should in  as well as the negro, because of the climates there are only negro as tho we are not human. i also think that men over the ages of 35 yrs. should be at home where they can get medical attention where they can relax when they are sick or crippled but in stead they are out in the weather sick angry & unfit for army life. if men were to old for  service jobs they should be too old for the army",black,0
763,,,i would like to know why the negro have to fight and after the war is over it will be the same way. the negro have no say so cant go any place they will not to go. in some states if they get on the the street car they have to sit in the back and if the white people set (seat) as fill they will have to get up and let them have their set (seat). all a white woman have to say in the south that a color man look at her to hard they will tie a rope around his neck but still the will not (they want) a negro to fight for them and men half of his life withe got damn army and half of them will get kill. and when you try to go home they will not let you but they still will not you to fight for them. and you know that is the truth but the negro will see they day.,black,8

776,,,about the training situation i think it is very poor some of the fellows are near home and can go home every weekend for a few dollars. but as for me it would take 4 months of my pay to even get home.  so i may never see them again at this rate.  all of the soldiers are not rich.  everyone should be given a privilege to get a furlough not just a picked group.,black,0
777,,,"i am a negro soldier from in the south and what i am interested in is how my people are being treated while i am away fighting for the rights of all. i am sure they are not getting the chance that they should, beacause negro soldiers are treated very badly especially in my state. i know this is not the right beacuse when on leave previsions are made to get white soldiers back to camp and negro soldiers are croweed to one or a half bus. i think the white man is very small to ask or force the negro to fight and still treat them as they do. i my self is feed up with the idea and would rather die here and help my people than to go and fight and my people be treated the same as before.",black,6
778,,,i don't think the negro is being given a fair chance as far as the armed forces are concerned. they should be allowed to be a part of any unit in the army. i prefer the 9th cavalry to any outfit in the army but i can't get back in it. i don't want to get ocs because i think i know enough or as much about the army as any officer that has graduated from ocs.,black,0

782,,,well in the army here there is a lot of things i dont like there is lot of southern white officers that i dont care about soldiering with and also the colored officers should get the same break as the white officers are getting. which they are not and never will i suppose but they are just as good as the white officers and some are better. so they should have the same break in all branches of the service as the white officer including the enlisted men as well. and get the same break all the way arround the clock which is fair if it would be like this the army would be are better army then it is now. so that is my point which is right in my . things would go much smoother to win their fight that we are on at the present time and their would be are better world.,black,3
783,,,"i think the camp i am were espeacly built for colored troops because its 40 miles from the nearest city.  they don't have another camp like this in the country so they though they would put negro troops there out of the ways.  they know if they would put them in the south that they won't that dist what those whites got for them.  and as a whole the dividson morale is very low because they think very much alike in so.  you may see them laugh and dance but you are not in the barracks to hear the rest. i think they might not.  this questionnaire is very good i am proud of the uniform i wear, my glad and country if my service here is not sufficient i want to return to civilian life and continue to serve as a war worker. i have no complaints to make. i am an obedient soldier. this questionarie is very good iam proud of the uniform i wear, my flag and country if my service here is not suficient i want to return civilian life and  to serve as a war worker. i have no complaints to make i am an obedient soldier",black,2
784,,,i do not think that some of the officers are fair about the officers they have under them. such as making white lieutenants better positions than colored when both are capable of doing the same why are there some and most of the colored officer no more than second lieutenant. i am sure that not all of them do not deserve a chance to get better rating than they do here it is impossible for all of them to not be worthy of rating. the army is runed to much by politics and syndicate,black,3

787,,,"another condition among negro soldier is the south. it is really critical. it is bad enough for a man to have to leave his home and fight, for a country that has in every way been unfair to him and has trid in every way to hold him down, and come to the army, and be kicked around by southern officer. we can almost over look this, but to allow the civilian population to prey upon us and offer us no protection against them. this can't go on this way. even the rough southern  an  and troop events we catch hell, and nothing we can do about it. that is why most of the fellow would rather have over seas duty, rather than serve here. at least some of the foreign countries appreciate us more than our own country of birth. but we are not going to fight this war and be allowed to be treated the same. for it is freedom we are suppose to be fighting for and we just as soon die for it here, as on a battle field in europe.",black,0

789,,,if the question were asked on the segregation of white and colored soldiers in anothe form the answer would be yess because the attitude of the white soldier toward colored in the south is that of superriorty and would cause confusion because in the southern camps they are prejudice do not treat the colored soldier fair.,black,7

792,,,how long will it be before we can get  freedom and they talk about and some white men treat us negro like dogs and you can do the same work as a white man and he will get the most money for it and the negro don't get cridet for what he do you can do something and some one else get credit for it and a white man can kick a negro and if he do something about it they want to kill him. all i ask is to treat us right and give credit where it is due,black,0
793,,,as for myself - i like army life. and i always did and do now. like to travel and see different parts of the world. but now my age and being unfit to do army duties. i feel like i could help my country win this war better by working in a defense plant back home,black,0
794,,,by this questionnaire will things be made better for the negro soldier or will things continue to be the bad. you read in the papers where colored soldiers are bean mistreated all over the south. why is not any thing been done about it. the morale of the negro soldier is very low and nothing is bean done to lift up his morale. what is wrong? are we dogs or human beans. i do hope that conditions will get better the negro soldier gives his life for his country dont that give him some right to be treated like a human bean something should be done about it.,black,5
795,,,the negro are being treated very nice now and that is just because the war is going on and some of the white people think that the negro are all dum. after the war is over there will be a big fight between the negro and white because they will not want the negro to go different places and for myself if i get back home after the war is over i am going any place i want to. if the negro was treated just like the whites are the war would be going on today.,black,5

800,,,"concerning that portion about the negro being treated better after the war, depends largely on what they receive while the war is in progress. some of the ways they treat the colored soldiers are really bad, and they are fighting for the good of the country. now you can imagine how much they will give to the race as a whole when the war is over. some of the people in the south act as a negro is to be treated as property but not as a human being who is capable or doing as much maybe more than they are. in some section of the south a colored soldier pays as much as a white soldier but yet he must sit in a certain section of the bus or train and then when that section is filled he is refused. there is one thing that seems to be misunderstood if a negro has constitutional rights where are all those laws that are put in effect in the south that a negro can't do this or that but when a war or some kind of crisis comes up a negro is one citizen and is one of the first called on by the government to do his share. if some of these people would who are always talking about keep the negro down would think for a minute or two they would find out that something is wrong with thinking capacity.",black,6

835,,,"this questionnaire, to my mind, is very well made up. the question have just about all the alternatives. the question in regards to the fairness of reports, white newspapers, about the activity of the negro soldiers in the army would call for quite a bit of imagination. the reason being, so little is said about negro soldiers in the white newspapers. unlimited space is given, however, whenever some confusion arises between white and colored soldiers. so you see again""ole"" race prejudice lifts its ugly head. my belief is that unfair treatment on the part of the white towards the negro is due to the lack of understanding and the mutual respect one group has fro the other. ""the road to victory is the one together.""",black,8

838,,,now is the time for negro to demand his rights before he is not needed. its best to learn what both races are doing and then compare them and to do so you must or should have them together. i think the negro would like more pleasure and and feel more like giving their life if they knew they was going to be treated like human instead of dogs. there is no chance for negro in the army he should have job in war plant where he is more fitted. i think there are too many men in the army at the present time and it makes mothers & children suffer from want of thing they could have that we are not getting.,black,0

1081,,,i think this questionnaire is alright; only one thing that question that speaks of better living conditions after the war: if we don't attain something out of this blood shed then we would have died in vain; there is no use fort so much hatred in the united states between races: if the children were taught what its all about when they are young the conditions would be better: after all we don't know what christianity is; to hate one and know not why is foolish: we are willing to die for austrians poland france and england; what about africa + india + china; and a better treatment here at home we would like to enjoy some of that to since half the world is getting some of it.,black,0

1084,,,"to break down the prejudice between the two main races of this country i think that we should have mixed outfits. when two people live together they will find out the likes & dislikes of each other. that is the same things that pertain to races. so why not have white & colored using the same service club, p. x's in the same outfit. i think it would work.  i really don't think there will be a lot of improvements for the negro but he lives here so he must help. i think if a person is willing to die for a country. i think that he should be entitled to all of the freedoms of that country.",black,2
1085,,,"well all i can say is why i want to be in the north. all y people have been there and i have not. so if i could go to fort custer mich, i could get to see some of my brothers and sisters there. why i say about the north, officers they treat you better and a man can soldiers under him better.",black,0
1086,,,"the army is doing a great job in training the negro soldier but too often the white officers from southern states don't respect the negro as a soldier, therefore it gives the army a black eye because they represent it. then again theres too much prejudice felt by some of the negro soldiers with the result he doesn't everything he has in his training. until lynching + disrimnation is done away with the negro soldier will never love his country as he should.",black,2
1087,,,i think about the whole thing all the time unliss we all pull to gather lither of us will see much of a helthy time we all should work like a clock if one is likin dont nothing move give every person a the same break as far as possable. i don mechanic work before i came in the army and that all i have on my mind and that is my dezies but i fail to get it although i am proud to see the other boys get what they wanted i wanted to be a flyer at tuskeggee ala. coundn't i wanted to get a chance to do some thand so i could get a higher rating so i could make my mother sisters and brother proud of me but now i have not i dont care what happen i do my part in any thing i am at and to help the states.,black,0

1101,,,"further wise the statement of the questionnaire, i think the white and negro now are far apart. most cases the white officer will laugh and talk with you, yet if he is from the south don't follow him  negro, in most cases, but classed as ignorant. in fact the classification of the negro is always taken from the lower class negro. all negro are not dumb. all negro are not ignorant. there are negro with quick thinking and fast working minds and are able to get the job through. if the negro and whites can fairly associate in the east and north why can't they in the south. the situation is as bad as the war itself. it can be better than it is now. in speaking of newspapers, if it is not a very large paper, a six year old child needs a pair of glasses to find an article about a negro, unless it is a scandal to the entire negro race.",black,14

1194,,,i have got any thing to say no more than i don't like it.,black,0
1195,,,1. the white papers seldom give the negro soldiers any write up or what they do. the only way is to read our colored papers to find out different things. 2. a colored person is willing to do his or her share but in some cases they turn thumbs down on them. 3. speaking of seporation between the white & colored is that every one may not get along peacefully. and the white soldiers & colored would not like the idea very much. 4. in many cases in the south a colored soldier is either killed or very badly beaten by the town police and nothing is every done about it. that shows how much he is appreciated in the service.,black,9

1218,,,i think that a soldier over 30 should be allowed to be station at a camp on this side of the sea and that all 18 and 19 years old should be training for actual combat and let the  from remain to take care of whats left back.  i don't mind being in the army but i hate to be sent where its  for me and  not outfit for combat after all i am  to to myself to help win this war i hope it will not last much longer so i think myself would be more valuable on this side than over sea because i could never make the  soldier for combat i hope it will be justified,black,0

1228,,,i think that the men in the lower grades should be given more consideration you have no right at all when you are a private. i think that noncom should be chosen by there ability not by friendship. i think that the officers should be more efficient. i think that the leader should be like by all of his men. as long as you are in the u.s. you should be able to visited home about once every three months or even more. i think that the men should learn how to soldier & not house clean. after the day is over officer should not be messing with the men all time of night,black,0
1229,,,i think the test as a rule was a waste of time. after channels has been opened for the negro both as a soldier and civilian but only as an appeasement. we have nothing in particular to fight for. in some place in the south negro were denied the privilege to vote they were beaten lynched and pushed aside. our motto is to preserve democracy. yet these things disprove a true democracy in the u.s. the same thing applies for england and other countries in the united nation. as a soldier i must fight or die. i will fight but not religiously. i will fight because i know i cannot win.,black,3

1376,,,why do the southern white soldier think that he is better than a negro soldier.  i find that the northern soldier is very much different and he white is not liked by the southern soldier (white) i am a soldier in the u.s. army. every soldier is a  citizen. every citizen should be treated with the same respect. i note that a southern officer will not give that respect. let me fight side by side as a soldier. after the war let me live too to share some of the liberties of life.,black,8

1529,,,i can serve better in the cavalry. we are taken out in the field and left out in the cold for 4 and 5 days half sick and nothing is done about it we will probably be in worse shape when it comes time to see action. we never have a day off. if the negro soldier is treated better he would feel he has a right to fight for this country his morale is very low. the white soldiers don't work as hard as the negro soldier. it is hard to soldier when you are force to be in something that you don't like. if i could i would enlist in the cavalry. i like that. i like horses. the negro today doesn't care whether he dies on that side or not because things are not like they should be here. we have a fight to win right here in the united states.  social equality  is what we want.,black,4

1531,,,"i wish this thing would hurry up and get over with because i want to hurry and get the hell out of here some days things go pretty good and the next few days it is rotten. and too here a soldier has to do a hell of a lot of things that isn't anywhere to be found in the rules and regulations of the army. we work seven days a week and dont have any time much of our own. i may be wrong but it looks to me that my superior officers just rough over us because we are a negro division, and personally i think the whole thing is a bunch of shit.",black,1
1532,,,together because we have some hated noncoms and senior officers the non coms are scared of there white officers and they run to the white man if the p.u.t. do anything. if we had all colored officers our co. would  better some of our white officers are out of the south where they  negro.,black,5
1533,,,"if we're fighting for democracy why in hell do they still lynch negro, if we do, fed fighting for a free world and then some body killing folks back home, i've been in the army for some time and read newspaper every day but never see what the negro is doing for his country and no news really i don't  we're doing anything and why do white men take advantage of a soldier. what can we do about it i don't mind doing anything for any body if its appreciated and i'm treated like i'm human, but some times i wonder should color make any difference when we're fighting for freedom or are we?",black,0

1536,,,i think it is very good if their could be any result obtain from it but from being in the army and being in the south having been brought up in the north where i was practically free to do as i please. i am afraid my government is not big enough to try to help out their poor colored people and they are getting me afraid in the south with the rest of the colored soldiers. they would rather fight there over there?,black,3
1537,,,i feel that it is a good thing to express one's feelings about the present conditions.,black,0
1538,,,"i have been in the service going on eight months. personally i think that i would have been much further advanced than i am had i been placed in a camp in a northern jurisdiction. our camp is  entirely made up of southern non commissioned officers. i was sent here from my basic camp with four other fellows. my present camp had already been established. the only chance i had to get anywheres was to work my way up. these southerners seem too down a man from the north, why i do not know. it must be jealousy. one reason is the average northern negro has had quite a bit of schooling, which the southern negro has not. it is their inferiority, i think, that causes the main trouble. i have the complete confidence in myself that i could duplicate the job of any non-comm in my company. i have yet to (over ii became a p.f.c. i haven't been given the opportunity too hold such a rating, though i have soldiered and i know it. i don't want you too take this as a beef, because i am a fellow that can take the bad with the good. it just gauls me to be under these half-educated misinterpretation of soldiers. who am i too chastise the doings of one of such  beings. in closing i say one thing i am still going too soldier, for i don't intend too remain a private during the remainder of my stay in the army. just a private.",black,0
1539,,,"they are a lot of questions that has been asked that i am undecided on. but know what i do about where i'm stationed at fully believe that the negro has no rights in this war. he is treated less than a man. has to be called out of his name, and don't have any right or reason for it to be done. this may be all right. but i believe i would do better in the north as a war worker which i started to before i came to this hell hole.",black,1

1542,,,i think this country would be a fine place to live if the negro were given a fair chance just to make a living and not mix together. but by giving him a chance to make as much as the white would bring them both together some white treat colored  fine in the south but others are just like slavery. i hope to see the day when colored outfits have colored officers but both fight for the same thing.,black,6
1543,,,"i am very thankful to have a chance to express my opinion in this questionnaire the way i feel toward our country, and i do hope we as a  race will get more consideration in the near future, for we as a whole it is impossible for us to go on like this with out the shed of blood so maybe by this chance and the few others the have to express their opinion we may get some consideration. thanks for the opportunity of this questionnaire.",black,0
1544,,, talk peace providing the leaders could be imprisoned & put to death  i've never read a acount of a negro actions in combats in a white papers  i have not come in contact with enoug mp's to pass criticism.  the soldiers contact with mps depends upon the way he present himself in public and that depends upon previous training. foe the way soldier acted in civilain life is generally has mode of serving in the army.  the accomodations service club is particular is not   on the same as same par as those of other camps that i have been in.,black,1

1548,,,there is too much ji crow in the south. everybody should be treated the same. the negro should be given more chance to prove his skill in the army. the anti-lynch bill should be passed. stop some of these southern white people from jim crowing in the army.,black,1

1551,,,it seem that negro troops should get a fair chance to become commissioned officers as quick as white troops a lot of negro troops are refused a chance to enter the air corps. we dont get a chance to learn about machinery as white troops we should have a better chance to learn more about different units in the army we dont get the proper training for personal protection we would like to become gunners in combat planes,black,2

1553,,,try to get all of the white people to see the harm of prejudice and discrimination against all races of color then this word democracy won't be something concerning white people's only.,black,2
1554,,,it was a very good idea to take this test. it should let you know how the men in the army are treated here and the reason i would like to be in another camp is it would be better. and i am glad you want to know how a man in the army to love good transportation. i think a soldier should stay out as long as he wanted to and the furlough should be given to the men that would want them.,black,0

1568,,,"i feel that if i am not good enough to hold certain jobs because of my race, then i am not good enough to be a soldier. in some parts of the united states a negro has to ride in the back of streetcars and trains and yet these same negro are drafted and told that they should be proud to fight for their country. i think that if a negro is drafted he should be equal to a white man. i hope to live to see the day when the negro are considered equal and will be able to demand their rights.",black,5
1569,,,time and education is the only thing to bring all negro soldier to understand also civilian workers and that is approaching  then white people will respect negro more they can work together and fight together. they should live together and play together.,black,1
1570,,,"i do not believe that there should be any separation or distinction of color in regard to soldiers. all soldiers are fighting for the same thing. all are supposed to receive the same rewards. how can this super democracy be practiced after the war when distinctions are made even while fighting for it. how can it be expected that the minds of white people will become adjusted to a new order of things when the same principle of our present and past democracy is exercised now. relationship between the negro and white people will not change after this war, for there will exist the same feeling of superiority and prejudiceness. no increased desire, on the part of white people, to bring the negro closer to him can come about, when there is practiced separation and color distinction in the forces which are fighting for the elimination of these things and which  the policy of white people. it is only by the elimination of the thought of white soldiers and black soldiers and the feeling that all are soldiers - just soldiers fighting for the same things and dying on the same fields of battle; that all soldiers will be regarded as the same.  it is only by the practice of the higher state of democracy now and wherever it can be practiced, that the negro could think and feel that it may be practiced later -- at least to a greater degree than it ever has been.  it is somewhat tragic that we fight for a state of world democracy which we know does not exist and will not be practiced by any nation in regard to the negro people, even after they have given their blood and their lives for it.  great britain could not practice a world wide super democracy without pauperizing herself -- which, she will not do.  it is almost ridiculous to think that great britain (especially) will carry out any policy of equal rights and equal opportunity for the colored peoples of the world, for by so doing she would face poverty and strife herself eventually of almost all which she holds on other continents.",black,12

1573,,,i think all white and negro should become reconciled with one another because god wants peace in this country. if we make peace here we can much quicker win this war. but a negro is afraid to do what he can because he is very much hated by the white. his life is not more than a animal. if a white person say a negro should be killed. and make any kind claim against him he is nothing but a change around his neck. especial in the south. that where all this kind of things happens. but a negro should do his best to win this war. in the name of the lord. if he doesn't do well he should be glad to help the white person. get his best god will be please with that. god bless this country,black,0
1574,,,"the negro, who is a citizen of the united states, is entitled to the same treatment granted all other citizens. when the army and navy takes part in segregating the negro in the armed forces and barring us from certain of its units it is using those means to let the negro know that there is one opportunity for the white man, and another for the negro. in england, and pre war france, black soldiers have fought and died together, but in our own country, hate and prejudice is so rife, that the negro cannot even die for his country, excepting in segregated camps, and units! i would like to see my country fight for freedom and liberty in our own country first, before trying to fight for it in foreign lands, whose people's do not profess to be liberty loving & democratic.",black,7
1575,,,the united states offers the negro possible more than any other country and tho' he does not fair so well in some sections of the country i think time + education of both the white + negro peoples in those + all sections of the country will go a long way to better the condition of the negro.,black,4
1576,,,there is too much discrimination going on to say every one is doing their part. the officers have better clubs to attend for entertainment also the 1st b grade of noncom officer's. some officers talk to enlisted men like they have tails. i don't think they should send soldiers too far from their home for their training. not enough swimming pools for soldiers. they should have maneuvers in the north instead of the south as there is too many riots in the south.,black,0
1577,,,race hatred is kept alive by constantly reminding one or the other that he is above the other or lower. now is the time to try out the good and bad ideas such as the mixing in px and service clubs. all's the soldiers need is a good common sense talk first.,black,0
1578,,,"and i think the war dept in reference to question (77) should always keep the negro soldier in a negro division, because in post war years it will keep down a lot of headaches for our future congressmen, and they will always know what the negro did or did not do and it will be an advantage to the negro race and it will help him in his fight for equal rights and if he do more than his share on the battle field he can demand equal rights. and that is why i say only a few negro soldiers training for combat duties will ever use it on  or against the enemy.",black,4
1579,,,the negro should prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he can be trusted much better than these foreigners that come here. why give them the highly important jobs when the colored man can do it just as well and has no connections with any foreign country. they will not be bribed or induced into giving away secret matters. so i say give him the chance he is an american and a true one.,black,2

1602,,,i hope the questionnaire has some bearing on the betterment of the negro race especially in the south. sometime places in the south is a regular living hell for negro peoples. in southern camps a negro soldier has as much rights as a mouse. they are treated so badly until sometime they even start riots among the whites. transportation are bad for colored soldiers in the south. i was born in the south and i tell you it hell to live among some of the white race. i believe there will be a time when the negro will get very tired being push around.,black,7

1726,,,"i dislike discrimination between colored and white soldiers on the part of the army. to win this war will take cooperation and color will have to be forgotten. the reason the other side is so far ahead of this country is because the southern white man goes out of his way to keep the colored man down. the southern white people seem as if they are not fighting any foreign country, but are fighting to keep the negro from advancing above his present level. when a colored officer is stationed in the south, white soldiers and officers turn their back to keep from saluting him. most negro officers are stationed in the north or on the west coast. white southerners would treat a yard dog better than they do a negro. roland hays of georgia. was terribly beaten because his wife refused to buy a pair of shoes. a southern white man wants you to kiss his ass to get along with him, but yet he wants you to fight to keep him in luxury. gov. talmadge of georgia said over the radio that he would rather see germany & japan rule the world rather than see a negro sit down beside him on a bus. the white people of texarkana cut a negro nuts and made him eat them because he was suspected of raping a white girl. i am sorry i don't have more space so i could speak my opinion more fully, i hope you can see my point of view about this whole set up.",black,17

1814,,,i think this was a wonderful idea and most of the negro should take this in deep consideration and not a joke. for myself i am strictly for the army and would have been in it before but i was informed they were filled up and there was not any sooner. at that time we had less than 5000 men in the standing army so you see i believe that is one reason why half of the negro who came from the south can't seem to realize that they are in the army. also that the gov. shouldn't't class all negro as the same.,black,0
1815,,,"most of the questions in this questionnaire are about whether or not & approve of segregation. well i don't approve of segregation and i think the army and navy would be better off if the soldiers & sailors were not put off in segregated camps. white and colored have to live together, work together and eat in the same restaurants at home in civilian life so why not have the same practice in the army & navy?",black,2
1816,,,i were  in the south of the camp & fort in the south during the time of being in the army but in a  i feel we as negro soldiers should be sent to camps in the north. i feel that if the white are sent to the north ore south they will see if better than we as negro soldiers. i have seen many of my pals who been called things by white soldiers from the south here in the same camp with us.,black,4
1817,,,i don't think a negro is given the chance he should have i think it is very unfair to give the negro the hard job only it is unfair to make the negro do all the work & no fighting. and the work he does is of no importance to the war yet they draft you from a war plant. i think it is very unfair,black,0
1818,,,they will look  at us an at the px they act like they dont want to wait on us an they act like they dont even want us in sight of them,black,0
1819,,,in the theaters out here the officers that are in charge dont give the negro a fair deal. they wants to give the best seats to the white soldiers and put the negro in the back of the theater. i think we should use our own opinion about where we want to set in the shows because i thought it was for all service men and we are doing our part to help win the war to so i think we should all be treated alike. because we are all in the army trying to win victory and not to make destriments.,black,3
1820,,,"there are some  all rigth and they are some no damn good atall. 59 the reason that i say that most of them are doing less than their share is because most of them are so prejudiced that they don't want negro workers in the same shipyards, factories ect. as themselves. therefore how could they be doing even half of their share",black,1
1821,,,"the white soldiers really don't like the negro soldiers because the negro soldiers acts right the most of them and the white ones don't like that. they don't want us for to have an equall change. they want to own every thing they see, and don't want the poor negro for to claim any thing. so i really don't think it is right. they should be like two brothers in the army.",black,1
1822,,,why are the negro fighting if they would have had a good reason to fight they'd feel more like fighting. the negro really is not being treated fairly.,black,2
1823,,,"my whole idea of the negro of united states in the war is, we know of no other country which to look to but the united states. therefore we have no choice of intering the army. we have very little privileges to fight for because of the bitter oppression we get. after the war is over we will be in the same boat as we were before because of white supremacy, which might be worse on account of the japanese hatred. we negro soldiers may do ever so much towards the war but will not be given credit as we should.",black,2
1824,,,"i feel that if some of the petty discriminations that are practiced against negro soldiers in restaurants, hotels, and transportation facilities were done away with, the morale of negro troops would improve considerably. when a negro soldier is refused service in any of the above places, he usually asks himself: what am i fighting for? am i fighting, being forced to give up my life, to perpetuate these things? must i always be looked upon as being inferior because of the color of my skin? in a nazi dominated country perhaps i would be required to wear a badge to show that i was inferior, even though i know i am not, but in america my badge in the color of my skin. i suppose he also wonders what sort of a regime will be in practice after the conflict is over. i for one do. will i have a chant to vote? will i have a chance to take part in the practice of democracy? will i still see my woman insulted and forced to  on certain economic ? will my brothers still be burned, lynched, and murdered and",black,2
1825,,,i am 100 per cent for anything that is right and willing to do anything that i am able to do. i do believe in doing unto others as i would have them do untu me. and as for this post there is no color women. this post is very hard for color soldiers. as i thing.,black,0
1826,,,i think this questionnaire is a very good thing. it will give each man in the army a clean mind to think  the results after the war and it will give everybody a little  which will help this from a  some of the men don't  from or all.,black,0

1829,,,if it make annie diffrence you can take all of the officers that don't like negro boys & put them in with the white boys & you will have a better army & better soldiers in the army. i say give the negro man a chance & he will prove to be a good man in the army. but please get rid of these white officers that don't like us so much that all i have to say?,black,4
1830,,,i think the soldiers should be more equal than they are speaking of the social they can't mix like they should but it is because the southern boys. when the colored soldiers are stationed in the south they are treated like they ain't soldiers the white treat them like they aint human.,black,3
1831,,,"we have a commanding officer which isn't helping the morale of his men at all. know one gets any credit for doing anything, even if its the very best. this always looking for faults too find with you, and he doesn't talk to you as if you are human. there are a lot of men here who could be more help to the war plants than too be a burden to the army, because there are a lot of them here who can just pick up there feet. doctors could remedy the ailments at least these don't seem too care too much for them. we have too be dead almost too make them believe we are ill. they think we are bull shitting too get out of work. we have the best 1st sgt. he keeps the men in spirit.",black,0

1835,,,in the first place i dont don't like the army. but while i am in here i am trying to do the best i can. but since i have in the army i have seen so many dirty things did agents the colored troops. it just make them feel like they are not being treated fairly. i thought wewere all in here for the same cause but it don't look very much like it to me. so you can take it from me. most of the colored are catching plenty of hell. you should try and do something about it.,black,0
1836,,,i' am doing fine in the army,black,0
1837,,,i truly don't think that the colored soldier get a fair break in some camps as other for the camp we are in it is jim crowed an i don't think it is right an we have some officers from the south an i don't think they are fair with the men in they outfit an i wonder do they look for coorpation from the men when they don't deal fair with them that is why i don't think it will be any better for the negro after the war for they will be fighting always for freedom,black,3

1839,,,if i can see it at the right angle the army today have to much seregation. and to much jim crow against the negro soldiers. in difference camps i've been it is certain places that a negro soldier can't go as a hold i can't understand why i can't have an equal oppitunity to advance my ambition in difference parts of the army. if only i had the privilege of expressing my feelings toward the army as a hold i could find on emillions comments to explain to some one who could help and bgetter the conditions of the army life in clousion it is to much decrimation.,black,2
1840,,,"the main thing is that we have one theater on the past, so all colored and white soldiers has been going to the same theater and sitting any place we choose, but now they decided that we should be separated. there for since, we all have a war to win why should we be separated, because when we get in combat soon we won't have that kind of time to think about  we should be looking for the enemies. i say that to say this, if we can be brothers overseas why not be brothers over here.",black,0
1841,,,"1. i would like to know why some of our color sgt and l.t. are so much afraid of their ranks than a white officer. 2 shall the army have a trial of a man who is in the guard house & the other man are on a leave. it was not me. 4 i had been in the army for two years and had not made anything but one a soldier should have that should. many time why do they take a man from south and take him north, can you help me to make something in this war or not why can't a soldier have more than two pr. pants can't he buy some himself or not can you send me to los angles california until the war are over or can you let me work for the government on a defense jaf. i can do more for the gov. were you try for me i am going to put my name on one page in this look",black,1
1842,,,"to whom it may concern. to my idea this war is the best thing that ever happened for the negro as a whole. the white man can no longer keep him barred from the finance which is so vital to his every progress. he is getting a chance to show his loyalty, intelligence and ability at a time when the united states are in an all out‚äã struggle against the very thing the american negro has been pounded with throughout his american history. and every man is getting a chance to see what the other man's part of the country is like which will play a big part in making us all feel alike and conduct ourselves likewise. my name is with helt. only at your desire",black,3

1848,,,why would we fight for people that dont even want you to sit in a coach with him or her. not even sit on a bus you are on but yet we have to fight for them kind of people. if you are working the same kind of job they feel they feel like are worth more than you and yet we fight for them why because we cant help it that why i would rather die right here fighting for a right to make a living in this country where i was born and paid taxes. negro have no rights all are lefts but there is a day coming that negro will take his rights if he gets a strong air force you know  you all try and keep him out of it that all folks,black,2
1849,,,frankly speaking i would always want to be separated from the southern white people but you find a few that are considerated but as far as being mixed with them i prefer not. another things i hope someday that the anti-lynch bill will be passed so as to stop so much of unesesary lynching in the south i hope there will come a time when if such things should happen the people will be punished by federal government someday this will be done in the south if it cause a civil war in the south the  down there is going to wake up but as for myself i hope for no civil war but i hope to see the time when the negro race will have equal rights in the united states of america.,black,3
1850,,,seeing as we are in this together we should all stick together during the war and also after the war. but i don't think it will happen until there is shown way out,black,0
1851,,,negro should be kept in camps in the north or in the west where he is put on equal rights with his fellow men.  they question has arose why negro military police are not allowed guns in the south. is he not a man serving the same cause and are not all men created equal. or is the u.s. dived into half. one part that is run by washington & the other run by individals who feel that the negro has no place in the world but to be a slave.,black,5

1854,,,the question about officers white or negro i have encountered several southern white officers and they don't give negro a fair chance although they are in the army and most of them are drafted the most white officers don't consider a negro as a citizen of the u.s.a. it seems as though they are are still slaves and must be treated that way. my honest opinion is that all negro units in the army should have all negro officers then we could have better disipline unless the white officers are some that don't believe in discrimation and give the negro soldiers that are qualified a chance to become commissioned officers. i believe negro officers regarless of rank can do just as good of a job as white officers,black,11

1866,,,i have nothing to say about the army but about the men who run it. with its seggregation of white and negro men who suppose to be fighting for one cause freedom. and about this lynching of soldiers in the south. there should be a law of anti lynching in the south and the negro put on equal basis withe the white and be given the same rights an jobs. and for the negro population be given a right to ride on any trains or bus or trolley car with out seating in the rear or on the smokestacks.,black,6
1867,,,if i could get into the outfit that i requested i would be quite satisfied with being in the army. my request was to be in a trucking outfit. i know that there are soldiers in those same outfits that does not want to be there so i can't see why adjustments can't be made to eliminate the dissatisfactory placing of soldiers. one soldier is given a job that  some else better than himself and visa versa. a satisfied soldier makes a better soldier.,black,0

1873,,,as soldier i have but one comment and that is i think they should be a little more  about giving furloughs. after all it helps morale and that is what will win the war,black,0
1874,,,i am answering these questions because i can see things this way. the question about whether colored and white soldiers being in the same outfit will bring them to a lot of things that the white soldiers and civilians have over looked. in the event that it does happen you'll see a great change in the future. that would look more like we are getting a little more respect from the white race. if we could have all colored lieutenant. and captains in these colored outfits. the colored soldiers would feel better. since being ill treated from some white officers. by this i mean you could accomplish a lot more than you have in the past.,black,7

1883,,,if i had my sayso about thing i would rather have colored office cause the white office dont give a damn about the negro soldier some of them is all right and some are not. all of the surthern white people are gin crow and dont like a negro but all of the north and east white people nose how to treat a negro. negro in the south dont have a chance every time his head is turn some one want to hang him or drag him behind a car or something. every thing to keep a poor negro down they do it and after the war a negro will not know a bit more than he did  before cause some in the east may cause they be treated better,black,9

1897,,,"i feel that i would be of more service, working on a defense job of some kind. simply because i cant make it on my feet other wise i feel i have no gain in fighting this war. but i dont mind working helping to win it. take it into your own mind and think, what chance did the negro have after the last war, which they fought in pretty  i figure it built to fight, but if you do not get nothing for fighting, it no good but so i said bbefore i am no good in this outfit let me a rank on a defense job of some kind",black,1
1898,,,"if the negro is an american citizen why should he be separated? if he is as the southern white man says he has no reason to be fighting.  conditions will be better if the colored man can ask for betterment of his race and get it now, but if he can't get any cooperation at present, there is no hope for his being better in the future.",black,5
1899,,,what i would like to know is what is the government going to do about the way colored soldiers is being treated in the southern states also what so many things are kept from us we are men as we were before the army got a hold of us. at least that is the way it is with myself. i am just a shell of my former self. i have nothing againse the army as a whole but after two years of the same thing it doesn't seems to be much that i would be able to do now.,black,0
1900,,,"the first place i really don't see why the negro should be in this war. the reason is this they have not never had the chance they made for themselves in that world war no. 1 but as i may say they all way's told one this were the white men world. but i am more than sure in the future the negro will have the chance as the white, but till that day comes i will do not put to the last. i no believe in helping the negro come up to the top and even standing as the white race.",black,6
1901,,,"i am in a western camp hut i've talked to a lot of soldiers stationed in the south and they say that the whites are not fair and think most northern negro should be sent to northern, eastern or at least western camps, never the south theres too much predjuice there. and i also think that the negro should have as much equality as the whites in the army, industry etc. if were good enough to die for our country at least let us share in it alike. the war would probably be over sooner if the whites could get that in their heads. they are losing a lot of valuable time. because the sooner this war is over the sooner the boys will return home to their loved ones.",black,5
1902,,,personally i think their should not be any segregation in the army. because some day we might have to fight side by side. if we cant operate so well in peace it cant be too effective in battle numbers. together we must stand individually we fall. yours for wietary,black,0
1903,,,first i am glad to have a chance to give my ideas on a few questions. also i believe this is something worth while as long as we are free men. i do believe this country will be better for negro when the war is over if we win which i believe we will.  also if we lose this war it will be tought for both because they believe in slavery also i dont believe it be a good idea to step if they want to. my idea is to crush them off the face of the earth because i soon as dead as be in slavery as my foreparent were i believe better color an white are joining their duty toward winning the war. so again i am thankful for this chance to speak my humble mind. hope in the near future we stay free an we must keep on fighting.,black,2
1904,,,it is a known fact that white officers from the south don't get along well with negro from the north because we negro from the north are not yes men to anyone. i am from ohio and the army sent me 2710 miles to an army camp in the west when it would have been cheaper to send me to a camp in the east. the  two in this camp are rotten i have had three leg injuries since last thanksgiving and the medical care they offer here is a shame to the profession in which these doctors  they can tell a man whither they thank the operations they gave him will be good or bad for his case. the army needs doctors who know what to do and when to do it.,black,1
1905,,,"why is it that if a colored commissioned officer in the 93rd div. is recommended for or given a higher commission he must be transferred to some other div.? why is it that the officers have separate mess halls, sleeping quarters, service clubs yet all men are created free and equal. before the war the negro was asking about his rights, but after the war i think he will be demanding them.",black,1
1906,,,"i think this questionnaire has covered almost everything in general, concerning the enlisted men in the army of to-day in regards to likes and dislikes, and i think its a very fine one in so far as it gives one a chance to express his own opinion frankly.",black,0
1907,,,"i have been in the army since june, 1941 since that time i have not seen my parents or girl friends. i have been sent to southern and western camps where i dont like the conditions and the prejudice of the white people as i am used to an entirely different sort of white person as i went to a mixed school where there were very few negro and i got along perfectly the army gives you a chance to make good but it also causes a man to have a don't care attitude after spending nearly two years in the same place doing the same things every day and not having any decent plans to go after he is through for the day. and this post is the end of nowhere. if a man could be near someone he loves he don;t feel as bad but spend two years away from everybody and he loses his sense of humor",black,3
1908,,,the most important thing is that some of the men that have been in the army for 2 or more years should be released and send in some of them damn loafers that in the street doing nothing some of the men out here have solider like dogs and still have a hard way to go.,black,0
1909,,,most negro think they have nothing to fight for and they are right i for one feel the same way because think of it i am in a u.s.a. uniform and try to buy a sandwich in a ten cent hamburger stand and white man tell me he dont serve my kind i feel like negro should fight their battle here in america and a many other reasons i could write a month about you have my views and about two million negro we all feel the same. but we know the white man on top,black,3
1910,,,the questions were pretty good i think you should let each company commander give one to his privates about his noncomission officers so he can find out how they feel about the leaders he has choosen. because in some cases some of them are going accidentally get killed in action. why do we have to train so long our unit has been training 2 years and 3 days and haven't had a chance for combat yet. which makes a soldier sour on the army.,black,0
1911,,,"the negro soldier and civilian are equal to any man or woman in any race given the chance and they could prove it. about the south it should be cleaned out, who wants and officer from the south, it would only break the morale and cause a lot of men to go to the guard house. my option is they should take all the negro out of the south then there wouldn't be an ""south,"" or any hanging and so forth then we would have a better chance to get  an equal break to choose ""our"" government""/] what we could do in only we were given the chance",black,3
1912,,,i don't think the negro has a square deal in the army because there are too many coms that like to tell the white man everything about his own affairs. i liked the army when plans here in 1940 a little are  i don't give a damn about it and don't want any part of it because there are so may kind of noncoms and command officers that are rotten and to many southern officers which they try to keep the negro from advancing over him. i don't like a white elephant or a charlie boy with his talk,black,5

1914,,,1-i am a negro soldier of the united states and in filling out this book let it seems if some one want to know about our affairs so i think with a little more curge in the  of us we will make the best union in the world of today. we will all have to be of the same faith to win this war. and from there we must try to bring all the worl together - to prevent futher wars. and our main object is to try to keep down any war or mutney with in our on country among our self,black,0
1915,,,i hope the negro be treated better when the war is over because we is doing our part only nations can  in usa and kill a nigros and they want so anything to him. it was a white man kill a soldier and he was a colour soldier and that did put him in jail at all that was not right at all.,black,1
1916,,,i think this is the most important thing that could be put out by the government. it give the colored race a very good chance to express his thoughts and mind under the prevailing conditions at the present time. i think this is the most important think that could be put out by the government. it give the colored race a very good chance to express his thoughts and mind under the prevailing conditions at the present time.,black,2

1921,,,i think the negro soldier should have the same chance the white soldier have because we all are soldiers. the negro soldier isn't getting the same chance the white soldier is getting. give them all even brakes they all are soldiering to win the war. now the negro unit being treated just for when it comes to fighting the negro get to fight and then isn't being treated fare. i think the negro soldiers should have the chance the [) soldiers have because we are all soldiers. the negro soldier isn't getting the same chance the  soldier is getting. give these all breaks they are all soldiering to win the war.  the negro unit being treated just same when it comes to fighting the get to fight and these did not't being treated fare.,black,9
1922,,,these last few words i want to say in behalf of the division is let us fight or put the colored man in defense work. we are having a slow death out in these mountains. we are getting tired of it. we came here to   fight and all we get is talk talk. if you all don't want us to fight put us back in civilian life and let us  and all of that.,black,0
1923,,,we have some doctors ant no good at all because every time some one gose there for an sickness they always give you a pill. that will not cure any one for a lot of things like me myself. i went up to the doctor a lot of times last summer with my heart. and ever time they only gave me pills. so i got mad and dint go any more so i still have trouble with my heart. so you see we need doctors that dont mind helping a fellow when you really need help. so get some more doctors that got some since,black,0
1924,,,"1. i thank we should have more high ranking colored officers. 2. we should have mixed officers in white unites so as to get the white soldiers aquinted with colored educatans.  every soldier should be given a fair chance to become a comm officer. colored soldiers should be shown more on the screen, so the public may no that colored soldiers is educated to.",black,6
1925,,,my company commands in a southern person he don‚äôt like negro soldiers. my opinion is that the idea i got to go and fight the enemy take a chance of died for so call my country with a man my leader and don‚äôt like i do think that he is a low down dirty person.,black,0

1928,,,"why is it a negro can't make any head way in the navy. why can't they join the marines. they should have all camps near town or city. a soldier would like a little pleasure after a week in the field or a hard day work. it will be kind of hard for a soldier to get a job after war time, so many new meshines. what if colored should be  in camps, because if we cross we possibly all will be. things should be made better for a negro after this war. why is it they post you in some thing else after you had one thing in basic training. why is it they have to send you so far from home & friends. why is it we don't have many colored flyers and training centers for them. we all should be given the same opportunities. we all should be treated with the same respect.",black,3

1930,,,"the gun  was very good my only hope is that some thing good comes  it, i have my doubts, and good will come from our god above we will never be any way near the white men if he can keep us down that especially true in the south, just be cause some one said the negro is no good the south has done him wrong and now every one mostly is trying to be good to him so as to get the best he can give if we should lose the war will all be in it together both in white & black!! no one is real sure what the negro will do be cause he has been trad so bad. but i myself hope that some day soon it will be over and we can live as one free man!!! thank you!",black,0
1931,,,"the united states has promised the negro a better chance to make a decent living; to give him equality, which is supposed to be what a democracy is for. but i think that we would feel more inclined to believe that if the u.s. started now instead of waiting until after the war. if we're to have a better chance at all, why do we have to wait? frankly, i don't believe that it is up to the negro to preserve the prestige of a ""democracy"" that only ever promises him anything when there is a war going on, and immediately after the war is over, develops a severe sense of amnesia. we don't bother anyone, at least not as a nation, so why can't we have the same opportunities here where we were born as a germy, japanese or italian?",black,2

1941,,,my company commander is hated by every one in this company. he makes the soldiers feel as though they are slaves rather than in the army. only one thing different about the army & slavery is they work you to death in slavery & kill you in the army. in the army you are you are told not to have any favors but they have favors. the soldier that soldiers best gets no credit at all and the soldier that does less soldiering gets all the credit. i thought the best soldier get the most credit.,black,0
1942,,,one of the objects of this questionnaire is to see how negro feel about the prejudice that is held against them well the majority of negro do not like it. one of these days things will come to a head and unnecessary killing will take place. we are fighting for this country. why not give use _equal_ opportunities to live in it. there are plenty of camps in the north and yet they take a negro soldier and send him to some hell-whole in the south. i am a negro soldier who volunteered for the air corps. they promised to send me there. do they? no. they send me to any branch of the service.

1955,,,i think this questionnaire gives every man a right to voice his opinion on lots of things he has had in mind before & upon entering the army and i hope it will help to change some of the difficulte that are happening. my biggest hope is that if  cannot be helped or stopped in the south. keep all northern boys in northern camps & southern boys in southern camps because soldiers from the north will never get me to the ways of the north & it only causes discontentment. always be some predused white in congress who will figure on some law to pass where by the negro will not be able to compete in a certain thing to boast him in his standards.,black,5
1956,,,"i think that every soldier + citizen should forget anything that would serve to create a feeling of distinction as to race, color or creed, and unite themselves and fight like hell to win this war. then after the war, let every man enjoy and share equal rights to the ""land of the free and home of the brave""",black,0

1960,,,i think this is a fine questionnaire,black,0
1961,,,there is entirely too much segregation in the armed forces. the federal government should pass laws to eliminate lynching and discrimination all over the united states how is a soldier expected to fight for his country when a few miles outside of his camp children of his race are lynched by a mob of people of another race. the armed forces should give the negro a better chance to serve his country to the best of his capacity. anything short of this will destroy morale and decrease his effective-ness as a fighting man and war worker.,black,1

1980,,,the colored soldier in this army is fighting merely because he has to and not because he wants to. this is our first big . no unity between our white and colored fighting faces. the other countries usually only and  and they are all together and therefore get more unity which is the primary factor in making this war. i don't feel i am being treated right my company don't feel their() being treated right . they dislike their () company commander very much. therefore if we went their () would be no unity and most of us would never get back for lack of teamwork and this happening in many places can lose the war. most colored c.o. are in the infantry or some other combat units never any place where he can show his skill by using his head. the colored soldier in this army is fighting mearly because he has to and not because he wants to. this is our first big . no unity between our white and colored fighting forces. the other countries usually have only one race and they are all together and therefore get more unity which is the primary factor in winning this war. i don't fill i am being treated right my comany don't feel there being treated right. they dislike there company commander very much. therefore if we went  their would be no unity and most of us would never get back for lack of team work and this happening in many places can lose the war. most colored c.o. are in the infantry or some other combat unit never any place where he can show his skills by using his head.,black,8

1984,,,the negro soldier in the south mostly: are not allowed a free say of speech. they will even put up signs in camps exspecialy this camp that will read as followering )(white only)  you do not even have a fair trial at court.  white soldier get more privileges and are treated more like men than the men of the negro race.  all southern camps should be checked for most-of officers will tell a lie in making out their reports. and the men are afraid to talk because he is down here with no protection at all. even walking guard with emty guns and even sticks. no one even to tell his trouble too - it is not fair. newspapers talks about there white soldier but not negro. the negro in the southern camps does most of the dirty work rather than train or even work at his trade.,black,6

1987,,,"the comments i make would take too long to write. i have never been in a northern camp but i do know it is never like this. i have seen and heard officers call soldiers niggers and the southern born, uneducated negro just laugh it off. they are far different from me. true democracy is never born out of oppression and we the black man down here are oppressed. who ever heard of a soldier burning leaves and being a soldier? what can i tell my people! shall i tell them the truth? certainly, the negro is more than willing to do his share but in return what are we receiving in return? how long can a government stand divided? how long shall we a willing an able people be oppressed? how long shall we be forced into a place of degradation? how long will the white citizens of mississippi be allowed to yell nigger take off that uniform you have no business with it on (this happened to me). since the government would trust us on our honor on the battlefield why not trust us on our honor here? i truly call myself an american and i am proud of it even though i am black but in finality i believe any man who is willing to lay down his life in defense of his country deserves an equal break. i am not entitled to more and i do not expect less. pvt clarence george coleman - asn - 12125431",black,5

1992,,,i think there is a bit of seregation between the white and color soldiers and i don't think we need any of that in a time like this we need a good spirit toward every man. they will cuss ask colors soldier up to sit white soldier sit down on the bus. and how can the color man have any fighting spirting. but god will take care of his peoples,black,2

2063,,,"1. why is it so much difference in the south and north with white people and negro? 2. will that ever be another slave? 3. will negro have better chances after this war than they did before? 4. will negro have to serve another war after this one? 5. what good is war in the u.s. if there are no more freedom between the negro and white. 6. if the negro are fighting for freedom, why can't they have it? 7. will the negro man have a better chance in the south after this war than he did before? 8. hoping this war will be the last war, forever.",black,10
2064,,,soldiers who live far from home should get more time off to see their folks.,black,0

2067,,,i don't have any thing to say about it all.,black,0
2068,,,i dont get furlough often a month,black,0
2069,,,frankly speaking thinking the negro should be given a even chance in the war jobs. and other jobs such as the motor transport lines in the city and for our negro troops should be given a chance to show what they can do in the air corp. and for the army i think my regiment can equal any combat outfit in the service i really think that the solider in the south should be given a better chance than they get. i think the law should take some part in to see that the colored solider shot down in their uniform on the streets like dogs and also riding buses they will have to ride the back seats. frankly i think a solider should be treated as citizens no matter where he go. of course i know it will take some time to prove to those illiterate white people down there that negro are part of this democracy to.,black,6
2070,,,"the company commander cusses me too much. the hospital shows an over amount of segregation. the white patients eat first; then the colored patients eat and at times, there is nothing left for them to eat. the u.s.o. on the camps shows disrespect in its' treatment of negro soldiers.",black,3
2071,,,we don't have enough privileges to go anywhere most of the time.,black,0
2072,,,the dispensary (medical detachment) treat the colored soldiers like a dog. (example) a howitzer ran over a soldiers foot all he got for it was a scolding. the medical officer marked him duty.  the men are half starved. the men are kept out in the colded weather and the rain. if they catch a cold nothing is done for it. an officer threated to hang every god damned one of us if we did not't tell who broke a rifle. the officer uses profanity and obscene language to the men. we have to work all the time even on sundays. (good) we get a chance to go to church every sunday. one of the acting noncoms writes home for me.,black,0
2073,,,questions are fair and nicely stated.,black,0
2074,,,i have been treated pretty good since i have been in the army. from what i can hear the hospitals are not so good around here. they have good churches around here.,black,0
2075,,,think it is well covered. glad to have chance to express my opinion,black,0
2076,,,they don't give me a square deal! i want to be treated like a human being.,black,0
2077,,,i don't like this camp and i don't think a man with a poor education should be in the army. the army can't waste a lot of time trying to train five or six men when they could be training a hundred men who are educated. looks like a man with a little education could do more on a war job than he can in the army.,black,0
2078,,,i think we are exposed to much and that there are a lot of unnesessary things that we do. i think it would be right for us men to get a pass for about two days instead of for only a few hours. i don't think my company commander is fair as he dogs us + doesn't treat us as humans. if i could get a half a chance i would be able to take more interest in my work and feel much more contented. and i have been a good soldier ever since i've been in the army have never given them any trouble at all.,black,0
2079,,,we as negro people was given a chance to do things like the white people and given things to do it with then we could go along doing things the right way then there would be freedom and love among all,black,2
2080,,,"i am proud of the chance to express my self on how i feel. i would like to see a time when we as soldiers are treated as soldiers by our non commissioned officer as well as our commissioned officers. because of their higher units we are cursed and put out of our mess halls and given extra duty work after a hard day of drilling in cold and rain. we become ill and are still kept away from our infirmaries and hospitals. i have seen soldiers fall ur for the lake of a little medical aid, when it is there for us. most anything put together for food cooked  and not enough for a house dog. it is usually  for us but just  of our higher ranking officers. they get a plenty and the best. we cannot make food soldier poorly fed. let our suffering be when we are facing the . the white man in the south is responsible for for the like (lack) of unity. would almost rather see the nation ruined than to give the negro a chance",black,2
2081,,,"all married men in the army should be tested to see if he has the ability to become a noncom officer because of the small pay he receives as a private. we should have some negro lieutenants in our companies. it would help build the morale of any soldier that is married to be near his family while training as before he go overseas. all soldiers that are in the army and married and eligible for war work should be replaced by single men, and put in to war plants. the negro private in the army should be looked upon by the white officers as lower in rank not as a man of a lower race.",black,3
2082,,,ala. is a hell of a state the worst of most i have been in. negro are treated very bad anywhere i have been.,black,0
2083,,,i would like to fight and die for the good if the negro race but jim crom is keeping the negro down i went on a hike and my feet went bad and i went to the doctor and he told me and some more fellow to get the hell out of their is that the way to treat a solder the most of the white doctor down here treat a negro solder how can he feel like fighting  he need to start fighting right here as a solder i am willion to do just as i am told i gest it was bad to be born black i won to thank you for give me  chance to explain my self,black,5

2085,,,"i, as a colored soldier am as much interested in destroying discrimination as much as i am in destroying the japs, germans and all other enemy powers. in fact discrimination or jim crow is as bad a enemy as any other power. a colored person can do anything that any other race can do, if he or she is only given the chance. why do a colored man be a janitor when he can be something else to provide better for his family? why do a colored person work side by side with a white person, at the same time doing the same work, but still get less pay than the white person. sir; the colored race has two powers to fight, discrimination and the axis powers.",black,6
2086,,,on nov. 3 i was in the california state guard was just made 1st sgt. when i was drafted. as to this hospital hear it is a hell of a place for negro to go. they have to wait for the white to eat and then go in behind them and eat on the dusty tables without be cleaned. and the latrines with asign for negro and one for whites. they told us that there was no segregation in this army and i think is as much hear as any where else.,black,4
2087,,,"i than the questionnaire was good with few exceptions they are as follows. did not ask about the food, a very few times that the men in my outfit get enough to eat. just this mornig the first sgt. told to tell anybody ask about our food that got a pleanty and it is good. he well knew it is a damn lie. some of the men have been in the army and has not got the family allotment made yet, if they ask the first sgt about it he tell, ""it is alright""",black,0
2088,,,"i like the questionnaire very much. it helps to educate anyone whether soldier, sailor, marine or civilian on what.",black,0
2089,,,in regards to the entire questionnaire there is a lot required of a man to become a good soldier. his physical condition for instance he has to be in good trim at all times for combat.  he cannot be a good soldier if his feet bother him or is back an any complain he might have. many of the men in service were not examined properly in the first place to determine whether or not they could make the grade a many man is in misery in this army not because he does not want to be but because he doesn't think of feel that his condition will carry him through. there is a many a man who has dropped dead. while in training because he was not physicaly outfit.  why can't a man have a thorough examination to avoid that? i have been in misery every since i have been here and don't think that i can make it but have to be slaughtered just because i have good blood a blood est does no determine whether a man is outfit or not.,black,0
2090,,,think the army is a good set up but some time the food is shy could anything be done about it and the cleaning equipment is poor in this camp could it be looked after. these are certain things needed looking after where are the officers in charge.,black,0
2091,,,it has been said the negro were fightin for  same thing as the wwhite people so why should it be that we have to to stay one place and they stay a another. it has been said no democracy but it plenty of that here. we should have a eagle break with the white man we are fighting for the same thing they are fighting they say.,black,0
2092,,,"question no. 8: after the war and i feel that i have been given a chance to better my conditions and i have made good i will want to stay. question no. 9: this my first outfit or rather camp so i do not know about the various outfits but i do want to keep trained so that if i am ever needed i'll be ready. question #8. after the war and i feel that i have been given a chance to better my condition and i have made good, i will want to stay. question #9. this my first outfit or rather camp, soi don‚äôt know about the various outfits but i do want to keep trained so if i am ever needed i‚äôll be ready.",black,0
2093,,,"i feel this is a very good questionnaire. it should give a good cross section of what we are thinking. from these  in  should come some solutions of this racial problem we have here in this country. when we as a group feel that although we are giving  our lives for this country the minute the war is over  the people we are fighting will at  have more privileges than us, makes us feel very badly. we know it is not right and the white people of this country know it is not right. why then in the name of god do the better thinking white people of the country permit such to exist. god help us to some day enjoy the things we are fighting for.",black,2
2094,,,i think negro officers with ability can get more out of negro troops. and i myself would rather negro officers.,black,3
2095,,,"i as an individual soldier will here say my opinion of this camp as ft mcclellan, ala. in the first place the negro soldiers have a rotten inconvenient transportation. i've been here almost a complete cycle and they haven't cleaned or changed my blankets. although i realize that i am a soldier and that i am not home or not to live on ""flower beds of . so far as doing my part i think that i am really doing that. i would very much like to be a non-comm and also a commissioned officer if i possibly could and sent to some better camp either in the north or some camp in the west.",black,1
2096,,,"i myself think that especially the negro soldiers would been better benefited and trained to defend the u.s. if their non.comm were selected carefully and the comm. officers would at all times dwell in their heads that first, we're negro and were here because we're training to defend america, mostly belong to them, and we're already unsatisiied, and on top of that, some of them tries to dog us around like dogs, that in time is going to cause war in camps. i feel like even in war a man should be given the place he says to be place, if fitted, there he will find satisfying service. the non.comm and comm. officers should be check regular to see if they are treating the soldiers as brothers. the soldiers should not from there pay be made deduct so much for difference things. the soldier as individuals have these trade and ideas, and should be given the chance to put them to practice as far as possible. i myself would like to do something at home, to cause the front line stronger as strength is the front line to cause home safety.",black,0
2097,,,i am 39 and perfectly willing to give my all. i feel that my legs won't stand the hard training we have to go through for i suffer from rheumatism and shortage of wind. otherwise i don't mind the army one bit. it's a fine place for building men up with me it just isn't here.,black,0
2098,,,i think this questionnaire was alright. one had a chance to tell just what he thought about the war as a whole. there is one more thing i'd like to add. i think that negro can general an outfit just as good as white officers. so i think they should be given a chance. thanks for the opportunity for expressing myself. a private.,black,2
2099,,,"we as a soldiering group and i, myself -- a negro soldier, we a negro race of the u.s.a. would feel much better if we would be shown a better chance, to erase hatred from the u.s.a. maps. i am only one colored soldier but i am sure that the negro troops, that is those made up from northern and western camps would feel like giving about real tasks in a more cheerful way if we were only be assured that we would be given our chance. again i say, speaking of the negro race in general, we feel the only way to conquer is to first erase the words prejudice and segregation from our midst. eaw",black,5

2102,,,this is not a question but most of the questions you all asked how the negro feel speaking for my self thing are bad,black,1
2103,,,i don't think the soldier gets enough passes to go into town. the bed check (i think) is too early a man should go to bed when he feel like as long as he make revelee. i think the older men should be let out whether he has a defense job or not. he could (i think) barely get one as there is a shortage of man power in production,black,0
2104,,,the questionnaire on a whole is good and it asks most of the pertnant questions about which most negro are concerned. if the answers and suggestions are acted upon it will lead to a more efficient country and army.,black,0

2111,,,"the only outstanding comment that i would like to make and i make this emphatically is - why are the northern men sent south and why the southern sent north. why can't we be near our homes? it would not affect the majority and the few who do make infractions would do it any where, i know it would keep the morale. i personally would like to see my folks and my wife. its horrible to be so far away and it don't help a person much -",black,0

2158,,,"i think this war is being fought on equal terms but as far as things being different between races i believe we are having it but as i can recall it was said there would not be any. but it is for instance, we was passing a camp one day on a march and i noticed a building ( a latrine) and on one side it said for (white) and around (back it said (colored) well the soldiers did not't like it very much and raved about it and on the buses dow here they have some marked for colored and some for whites and even any where a colored soldier may go you see signs for colored and signs ( for white and i don't believe it is right because we are all fighting for the same thing and our life and country is just as dear to me as the next mans is. so i don't think it is any more than fair to share the same things . if you send home the boys much for kicking against certain things and if some things was changed us colored boys would feel a lot better about fighting than they do.",black,6

2162,,,"i think it will be better to let some head man to see this, probably he will try to do something to get me out of this army and let me return back home and make my living by farming, for that is all i ever done in my hole life and i want to remain farming for my living. it is more pleasant on a farm than it is in the army, because we don't have nothing to fight for they othen to sen the farmers back for to suport supply for the army. if they was going to draft negro they orter get all out of these large towns and left all farmers their to continue to farm.",black,1
2163,,,the reason i did not give a better answer about the army i am a new soldier and have not had time to learn that much about the army. the reason my answers  are  as poor as they are.,black,0
2164,,,these questions that i have just answered has just about covered everything. a few main points i would like to bring out is the fact that the mo's are a bit too harsh on soldiers. the transportation around this camp is entirely too slow. it takes a soldier half the night nearly to get out of camp and sometimes he may be going to town to shop. when he gets there everything is closed. the fact they brought out about the negro living conditions after the war was a good question. i hope it is better. a lot of the negro feel that they do not have anything to give their life for. when a man fights for something i think he is entitled to it.,black,2
2165,,,"the service thhe boys here in camp get is hell when we go to town and try to get on the bus the white m.p. will make us stand back and wait till the white get on the buses on one occasion i  i and some more soldiers were trying to get back in camp and they had standing room on the buss only and the white m.p. would not let any colored soldiers get own he only let the white civilians own the bus and he knew that the soldiers had to be in camp for role call at 6 oclock that morning they just dont do the colored peoples right, in the south you cant sat beside white peoples own the buses  yet they say we is fighti ng for rights is that right, man is man where ever he is that what i though.",black,6
2166,,,"as i have said if the negro was given a change to feel that he was being given an equal brake, both in civil and army life, he could do a much better job. i think the u.s. army should have all the people or soldiers as we might call it in one body, by this i mean, the white, chinese, negro and us soldiers eachin one body and then divide the talents not races. if we as negro was made to feel this way we could get the job done in a hurry. not only do i feel this way but the average negro soldier does. in my company i don't think we or i am being given a chance to prove myself and show my dignity. i find that also the officers give only those people ratings that can curse the loudest and insult effectively, and not that person that know how to get things done. i sometime would prefer the guardhouse rather than the barrack, and there are many more like me.",black,3
2167,,,we should be brotherly and work together learn  on another and then there would be unity and where there is unity there is strength.,black,0
2168,,,"i don't see any reason when the white and colored soldier are in the same hospital, why the white soldier always has t he first preference to eating. if they wanted to treat all soldiers equally, let one eat first one day and the other the next day. many cases, soldiers are really sick and made to go out in the field anyway, which puts them in a worse condition than they would have been otherwise. the doctors in charge of the sick call has no consideration whatsoever for a negro soldier who has just become ill. a soldier shouldn't't be made to go out and train in  weather, which causes a lot of unnecessary sickness.",black,4
2169,,,"we can all get together and pull together and we will win the war if everybody cooperate together it willin a year- give the negro a chance like the white and they will cooperate together. we cannot fight with our hand , give us the same training that you give them and we willif it be good when the war is over, if they cannot cooperate together we can start another war- right and is what the negro want they will have it and cooperate.",black,1
2170,,,i am thinking of the present days of the poor people in the civillian world that is suffering for the like of labor and fasting for the waste of the boys of the camps i thank there should be something done immediately for such falling humanity. i hope the war will close with victory to or in favor of the united states of america.,black,0
2171,,,we as individuals are fight for the same cause so why be different let every man be treated the same and have the same rights if white or black each man do his part and win the war so each will be free and live a happy life because when god call us there will be no different between any race.,black,2
2172,,,"i don't see why white soldier should have different camps from us because a colored soldier has the same flesh and feeling as the white man has, we all are men and we all is got to fight for victory, so i don't see why a white soldier should have any more wrights than the colored man.",black,5
2173,,,the training that the fellows are getting here is very incompetent for the job they have to do. the northern negro is not allowed to show his ability here. this camp has non coms who have not completed their basic training and they are unqualified to hold their positions. this camp could also use better material and greater quanities. it also needs seasoned officers for training of men.,black,2
2174,,,the office don't treat the negro fair they don't get  hardly to eat they cuss you when your  wore out they want fix them they want give you know  and they got to fight for their country the the mess sergeant cuss you like a dogs they won't let you go no where you restriced the the  all the time and when a man wife come up to see him they won't give him know pass to go to town with her. some time they won't let you go to the shore you have to stay in the only you can't go no where but the  and  in your  i think it away bad for a soldier can't go no where to  his mind together if they  of them going to leave and they going to have to come and get them,black,0
2175,,,if these questionnaires are studied carefully we can win the war and have peace of mind. we are given a chance more or less to tell what we think about white people - well down here there are not what one would call real human being because take for and instance if we were playing tug o war and each side had 10 men the side what all ten pulled to-gather on will win. think it over.,black,1

2229,,,this questionnaire seems to be only a discussion of the race question. my candid opinion is that if a man is good enough to wear a united states uniform he should be good enough to go anywhere and do anything as long as he is a gentleman. for the time i have been in the army i have found out that most southern people hold negro soldiers in high contempt. if this country is fighting to preserve democracy let it really begin at home because how can a man fight to save the country that lynches his people and absolutely refuses to recognize them.,black,0

2236,,,first of all there isn't enough to eat here in this camp. in comparison with the work we are required to do as soldiers. the non-commission officers seems to forget that the soldiers are human beings. they do not care how they talk to us. i do think that a furlough every three months isn't asking to much. especially when at any time we might have to overseas. regardless of everything else we as soldier love our family. we want to see them as often as we can. if we went across it would mean a lot to know that the army did its best towards us in that respect.,black,0

2891,,,this questionnaire is a very good idea it gives me a chance to speak my open mind. transportation to town here for soldiers has been very poor until last saturday when they made up their minds to take the soldiers to town and bring them back. treatment here of the negro soldier is bad. where do they get the idea from that a soldier can be kept away from his wife or mother and family for 6 or 8 months and do not want to give him a furlough to go home. these officers do no do that they have their wives or girl friends close at hand. the way we are treated here a good man or a man that has a clean record through life would do things he would not do if he had certain privileges. i am a soldier and have a clean record not only in the army but also through life but if they do not give me a chance to see my intended wife and mother soon i will have to resort to other measures.,black,0

2967,,,the conditions in the south are very poore for the negro. they go to town and the lease little thing happen. they are beat up by the white people and into jail he goes he hasen got a chance in the south. give him at least as much of a chance as the northern negro have. the old saying together we stand divided we fall.,black,5
2968,,,"this group of our could be a damn good + hard hitting outfit if it could get fair + unbiased treatment from its officer + non commission officer instead they continue to have a friction   both officers, non-comm's + soldiers instead of having a united group of man + officers working together for the benefit of winning this war. that the man should get food well prepared not garbage + cold meal and that all the time because the army support itself on its strength + strength is contrived by good food + fair treatment + ability to make it a pleasure to  be here + do his part for the country  lives + gets his means of support.",black,0
2969,,,"pertaining to question 51, my ideal is when our people go after anything they never stick to-gather.  the bus situation is very fair under the circumstances but i don't think it should be.  my opinions about the camps is that northern boys be sent either north or west. because it is fairly hard to get yourself ad-justed to the south. pertaining to question 51, my ideal is when our people go after anything they never stick together.  the bus situation is very fair under the cirumstances  i don't think it should be.  my opinion about the camps is that north- boys be sent either north or west. because it is fairly hard to get yourself  to south.",black,0
2970,,,i do like the army work and i think it has given me a different outlook on life.  but it has been pretty hard for me to ajust myself to the army after settleing down after seven years of married life a fellow is a little slow on some things.  i would like to see this thing over with so all of us fellows can go back to our family,black,0
2971,,,i think this is a very good questionnaire for it allows one to express his feelings about many things. i hope very much that a lot of good comes from it .,black,0
2972,,,i have tried to be fair on answering your questions. i hope you will get my ideas i credited things & people as i actually see them daily. i have tried to be fair on answering your questions. i hope you will get my ideas. i credited things & people as i actually see them daily.,black,0
2973,,,expl. 75. white men & negro men should learn to know the ways of each other now because when they are in the combat zone there is no way for the two to learn one another. if the plans are for negro units & white units  to fight separately then there is no need for association here.,black,3
2974,,,i think every questionnaire should have serial numbers on them and names,black,0
2975,,,most soldier have but a little time to stay here. why not treat them right. they dont ask much only to havea good time. when a soldier goes to town he has his ideas of what he wants to do. why do you give a soldier a brake and dont have so many mp around his place of fun. after all a soldier is stock or a heard of cattle to be shoved everywhere he goes.,black,0
2976,,,"all questions were fair and plain enough for any one to understand and to give all concerned a chance to express their own views. comment about our combat outfit which is suppose to be a fixed unit that old story of the army traveling on its stomach is a lot of  for a fix unit we average 10-12 miles a day walking which seems to me has no  place at all in our training, not so much of it anyway.",black,0
2977,,,as far as the comments goes in the negro and white soldier they are as follows it is a disgrace and ignorance for the white soldier to feel prejudiced against a negro soldier to be fighting for the same cause one of us may save one another's life some day on the battlefield being from the north i feel damn mad and ill feeling for the white soldier in the south that is not all of them the mp's more than any thing the white man does not realize in a time like this he is hurting him self by his own ignorance as well as his country. then they expect you to give your life for nothing.,black,3
2978,,,there are some very good questions on here and they will really puzzle you very much but we know very well that the negro is not getting a fair deal in this war today. in order for there to be success in the war as well as in any other thing in the u.s. this race problem will have to be stopped. of course i doubt they seriously if these problems will ever be solved. so there fore this world as a whole will never pull together as it should. the u.s. will always be a downfall.,black,1
2979,,,the army should look into this racial problem particulon  in the southern camp. they also should provide better recreation facility for the negro. should have more negro officers,black,0
2980,,,as a whole we are not being treated as humans. some like slave & animals. if we can't do and take part any different  of life why just give us a flag and country of our own. then you'll be free of us. we as negro folk suffered enough.  the whole thing in a nut shell is that we have forgot or teaching we have thrown aside the most important thing in life. we have for got who has made it possible for us to live and carry on as men and women of the  land of our through aside the ten commandment and last we have forgot god consequently as a whole our being punished. now lets get back to god back to his discipline and our country will glisten with the radiant glow of love. god and love,black,0
2981,,,"the negro is forging ahead you better give him his chance because he  sabotage your factories he is  himself due to this war and the time is coming when many things in this country will happen, if things are not changed. this might be called a war for freedom of speech and way of life but it is really a race war. one race has dominated too long and the time is coming when there will be a change.  in the bible it says the last shall be first and the first shall be last so look out, because the negro day is coming",black,3
2982,,,i think the war will be in the united state the next time,black,0
2983,,,army life is ok - as long as you know what you is fighting for. freedom and security i am fighting for both. there should be no discrimination among the people because of color. the south is unfair to the negro soldier not all people but the majority of people in the south is very toward i think some-thing should be done because you lose your fighting spirit it makes you stop and think what am i fighting for when the very people i am fighting for call me regular names. i look over this remark because they are ignorant,black,3
2984,,,"because no matter who win the war the negro is still going to be the under-dog. although i will fight to the end for the united states because this country is still the best and freer nation in the world. but i do believe the negro should have a better chance to live like the white man and have the same rights. this suppose to be a democrary, the white race better wake up and fly right.",black,3
2985,,,"(1) as a whole, i think the question are rather good, it is a good idea you can see just what every negro think about this war, and the way he is treated. personal, i have always been treated fair because i were never in the south, but since i have been in the army and have been in the south all my   time, well i have had some pretty bad .  and i do , that with in a short time, that it will be a great change, because a lot of the negro race are waking up to the plain facts. and i really dont believe they will countinue to take thing the way they have been going on. that my opinion. i thank you.",black,0
2986,,,"some questions or must i say all could be answered if you could just trade places and see how the other half lives.  you would be horrified, believe me at some of the conditions  and it doesn't make it any easier for me since i'm from the west. i have played, with white boys swam in the same place as white them and went to school all my life with them. even fought then but they would take it and i would to, and nothing occured from it. they would whip me yet we never lost  our friendship until the leave and let some people put crazy ideas in their minds l burst? who knows?",black,2
2987,,,"i think this way will make it better for all soldiers and we will all deserve equality for i believe we are defending a just cause. and i work my very best to be outfit and feel that most other negro do the same. and about the  don't know which post i like best but i  i would like north, south, east or west.",black,2
2988,,,"i would like to know why soldiers can't get a pass to town when he is off duty, they can't do any thing else, so i think during the time that a man is in camp he should be given some rights.  my health is not sufficient for combat service in the army. what should other men do that in my same condition.  my health is not good so i think that i could help win this war by working on some kind of a war job.",black,0
2989,,,since i have been in the army i have been unable to understand this ordinance works. i believe i will make a  better soldier in some other branch of the service.,black,0
2990,,,i am hoping that these question that i have answered will not throw any reflection or hold any thing against my race of people.,black,0
2991,,,i dont think i have so much to say about the questions more then i think  hope reaches after this war we will have some equally of as well so is the white man,black,1
2992,,,"outfits the same as they are together in the large schools for training. in my opinion, it is one of the first traits of a poor soldier regardless of his race to  not have respect for a fellow soldier because of race or creed. it is beneath the high degree of discipline the u.s. army is striving for. seeing segregation on a large scale for the first time it seems to me to be a  tradition more than anything else. i feel that in the army and during this war is the ""ripe"" time to start training minds differently.",black,0
2993,,,got love us all and he will take care of us all if we do right and love one another that what the bible say so we had better worry and get on the ball now why we got our health,black,0
2994,,,does not have any other comments about this questionnaire,black,0
2995,,,i will not say that i dont like the army because i do a little but i think a man can take the training without being dodged around about some one else  in fact for   some person left undone,black,0
2996,,,"not because i am a negro but because i blame it on trust. i will say that i believe if the negro had more power this war wouldn't last as long due to the fact that when a negro get into something he will put all that he has into it and get it done. while the white man is trying to keep the negro down the japs and germans are fighting like hell. the white man must get up off the negro before the war can be won by the u.s. let every man be a man no matter if he is colored or white and we can win this war. ""god bless america""",black,9
2997,,,i came into the army with a desire to fight for the ideal set forth by our commander in chief as i believe in these principles. they did not practice them in civilian life and democracy was a word to be given lip service. not practiced. some have tried to carry this thought in the army and in some camps prejudice and unfair practices still prevail. it is gratifying to know that there are some white men who are fair and unbiased enough to attempt to carry out the ideas of democracy and not for the sake of superiority in color. hitler and his practices are too closely paralleled in the thoughts of some individuals and groups in our national setup. a commander of negro troops who was born and raised in sections that adhere to certain traditions and customs regarding the negro is out of place in this fight and cannot practice democracy.,black,1
2998,,,"most negro like myself love this country and don't mind fighting for it, but, we are tired of taking shit for the southern off of the southern white man.",black,4
2999,,,9. i think you should have 3 months of training. it would take 2  to get back to your self to your old training,black,0
3000,,,i would rather be in the north because i'm not used to be told to go into the back door of business places. there are more cooperation between the two races.,black,0
3001,,,"i feel that this questionnaire is very useful to the government of the united states, and will help make thing better for this country.",black,0
3002,,,i thank the ,black,0
3003,,,well the first thing is when a man is 34 yr. or over he should be in a defense plant he could do better than in the army take young men from 18-28 he will make a good soldier but when a man get 34 or over he is no good for running and jumping he will give out. i think they should let all men out of the army that age let them work in a defense plant where he will do the most good. a man from 34 or over he can't soldier like 18 yr. to 28 he haven't got the wind. so i think a man from 34 and up should be in a defense plant where he can do the most good.,black,0
3004,,, the man come to th ward but in the war is these must to do  to see me to ,black,0
3005,,,,black,0
3006,,,the reason i don't feel that what  serving in the army is  that the negro are not treated   the constitution of the united states. negro do not have equal . on the other hand if i america don't win this war we will all be slaves to hitler. if i knew that my  would be treated better after the war i would not feel i have done my part in vain.,black,0
3007,,,i think it is a wonderful ideas to get even and opian about it.,black,0
3008,,,"i think the examination boards should be more fair in examining me for armed forces. men sent in the army not in good physical shape, are going to be as capable as a man in physical shape  as much work is expected of the man in poor physical shape as the man in good physical shape. with him not being able to do as much as the next soldier he is continually catching hell from sgts. and lieutenant. they give him hell because his is a soldiers and is supposed to do it because he is supposed to be a good physical soldier i am not saying it because it is the same case with me but there are hundreds of cases throughout negro army camps, and some thing should be done about it. some men on limited service could do more in war jobs than in the army.",black,0
3009,,,i do not believe in white and collord mixing but think a collord man should have a chance at anything he can do to help win the war.,black,1
3010,,,the war could be  easier to fight if everybody was allowed to do the part in which they are fitted for. it will not be won unless the  which is going among the different races is stopped. if a man is able to do a certain job in civilian or army he should be given it to do   it will take a lot more thing to win this war by training people unfit for certain things. if a negro can't get in the outfit he wants and which he can do the most good why is he fighting at all for. it is all ready proven that the country needs  but yet because of the country history it will not stop the racial discrimination and yet it is fighting for freedom of other people and countries to save our own face. we are not asking to  live under the same rood but just want the freedom of speech  and privilege as other citizen have.,black,1
3011,,,"this was a very interested () questionnaire () and it brought a lot of good points and thoughts and about the negro specially but i believe the negro will have a fair chance after this war and the negro soldiers are being treated pretty good in all the camps we have sergeants lieutenant, etc.",black,3
3012,,,in many of these question i have not yet been experience in. i have not been in the army very long and i am not but 18 years old. and its the first time i  been away from my mother. i am worring because i don't know when i will see her again i have had no experience and i do not understand,black,0
3013,,,this question is good and it asks some very fair questions as a whole. it asks would i like to be a commissioned officer well i would very much and i wish they would give me a chance at it. i have a very good understanding and i believe i could make it all right once i had the chance,black,0
3014,,,frankly speaking i know of no better way of getting the different opinions of groups on such vital questions than this questionnaire and i did enjoy participating in it. may we as a race be able to reap benefits from it in some way.,black,0
3015,,,"i believe alone with our equipment, our phcal trained bodys ect we must carry with us the feeling in our hearts and the truly, sincerely, faith that we'll win. i believe if every soldier believe that we'll win, we have won. i believe if some time was set aside for the purpose of being american soldier  together as complete brothers it will be a great weapon for the enemy. i do believe this statement: ""as a man thinkest, so is he""",black,0
3016,,,i don't think a negro should fight to help a man like the southern white man because as soon as the war is over the southern white man will be ready to continue his little lynching parties.,black,5
3017,,,it is nothing else but in  been treated unfair so long till it slow real now. i don't have nothing to say about it and dont do nothing about it so i am trusting in the lord that we will win this war and we will go north and get together and try to get on some time. i believe if we had been closer together that we would not  in war now. so let all look to the front and keep the faith and whin two war and dont for get to pray. pray will enough timing.,black,0
3018,,,"this questionnaire is very good to show how i feel toward other people. and the mes that are here are full of  and that the one season  so many soldiers catch . i would like a camp where colored are treated more like humans instead of fools etc. after all, we are human and we don't have any clean girls to be with and you know if they are not clean they couldn't be  and what more i would rather have a job that pays (just for instance) $50 a week, i would rather earn $50.00 and give the money  of my salary each week rather than be in the army. in fact i have been and always will be mad and angry until i get some place close to my """"mother"""". camp rucker is one of the  more places on earth for colored people because it is  to for  and no colored man like the . it is a fact that every there race from any pact at the  earn come to armies and get angry kind of a job better than one can. you know the colored men have won every  we fought and get less credit.  our privilege and of every thing than any other one. these are going to be something done someday ",black,4
3019,,,"well it is one thing not fair is for the colored. the colored communications officer gets tuff breaks he can or do go to the different schools with the white officers and, after he finishes and goes to some camp, he cant go to the service clubs with his white buddies or they are segretated from where he goes after he gets off the field it is not fair and i hope this war will wake up the younger generations and i believe this will be a better world to live in after the war is over, because it has opened up a lot of new avenues for the negro which before was closed to them and the world know we are willing to give our lives as freely as any white man although we haven't had the privileges they have had.",black,6
3020,,,"the laundry service at this camp is very poor. clothing is sent back rough dried and tied together. part of some is lost each time sent. room for improvement. mess sergents could talk to persons as though they are people. meals could be a lot heavier, and balanced. in general the conditions surrounding camp are very poor. by this should a soldier go to one of the neighboring towns for entertainment or recreation he is crowded out. as for companionship that is a thing of the past. the are at least ten soldiers to one girl in this camp. that makes it very bad. more entertainment and recreation is needed along with some respectable young women. other wise more weekend passes to town.",black,0
3021,,,i would like to know what this is all about.,black,0
3022,,,some time white people know life an the young boys don't that the reason why some time they don't get along but i feel that a colored man is as good as white or any other human being after all god all might have all of us in his hand.,black,3
3023,,,i would love to  in the  but in my condition i am unable for any but i no i can't stay in the army and not do any thing so i will try to do the best i can and ask the good lord for strength and to help me for if i was out i would not feel any better for i  in pain for about 10 years and now i am just about to  give up so i need help before i can ,black,0
3024,,,"keep the negro soldiers out of the south, or should i say the ones that don't know any thing about the south. why send negro corps. officers to the south to some town away from anywhere they can have good clean fun it is a lot better on enlisted me than are officers don't get me wrong that is not saying no hell",black,0
3025,,,being here has it disadvantages as well as it advantages. the south is so con  the colored have a  way to do. the office happen to  and they a none cooprative buck fast for self. and don't give a damn about the  all they want to do is just eat his ass and all the time and make him have a hard way. so after the war of there in isn't a vast difference the repo will be treated the same.,black,1
3026,,,"this questionnaire would be ok if the war department would make arrangements for the colored soldiers in the south to get just treat and have those civilians bought to justice that oversee  them, and they could also stop that jim crow on city buses and training.",black,2
3027,,,in my outfit as far as i amconcerned the  soldiers are treated pretty . about the bus lines they a fairly good just the idea of being in the south makes a  boy feel bad no matter how he is treated. as for a   every one feels like it is his duty to fight whether he is in the south or ,black,0
3028,,,well we get half enough to eat next we are cussed at all the time next wee had to stay in a month before gaining to own]anything next we do more running than any other bn on this past next if the bus have  white soldier on we  and we can't do nothing to please nobody at all they don't  no  in the baracks when we are there,black,1
3029,,,i have not any more ,black,0
3030,,,"i think it wasn't necessary. because to write it, they should know what the average negro thinks. as for some of the questions seems nothing is being done about it and has been this way for quite a while.",black,1
3031,,,my only comment is i hope the war brings both the colored an white man closer together,black,2
3032,,,"why don't you people up there in washington do something about transportation down here, we colored soldiers are tired of being picked on, laughed at and called niggers by white soldiers and civilians or there will be a small war down here. give us a chance or in other words aren't we doing our part in winning this war, we are giving our lives too.",black,0
3033,,,"i'm a negro and i'm proud of my race. i'd rather be an unprejudiced negro than a prejudiced white man. god put us all here for a reason. millions of people are breaking god's laws everyday in reference to the negro. the negro has been loyal to america. we love this country we fight for it, we work for it, and we pray for it every day and still we are mistreated. the negro is the only person that is having prejudice thrown at him everyday. still he never gives up. he can take it and he has proven it that he can dish it when he gets in combat. you put the japs and the nazi's before the negro now they are trying to kill us all. when it is over you will do the same thing. personally i'm a good citizen ( i'm bragging as i'm proud of my race and this country) i've never been in jail or no trouble. i'll fight like hell to get back to my mother even if something that happen in this country makes my boil. i can take it and still come back fighting. i can't see where this race problem can ever be straightened because of narrow-mindedness, prejudice, and jealousy. i'm a good citizen (i'm bragging as i'm proud of my race and this county) i've never been in jail or no trouble. i'll fight like hell to get back to my mother but some things that happen in this country makes my blood boil. i can take it and still come back fighting. i can't see where this race problem can ever be straightened because of narrow mindness, prejudice, and jealousy.",black,6
3034,,,"why make a mountain out of a mole hill. when you take out the southern predominance of negro and put both races on the , then we will have something. we are all fighting for the same thing, why in hell let a bunch of southern whites be the set back of a group of americans that are americans. the negro. do not let our dear country turn into another germany. remember her treatment of the jews?",black,5
3035,,,i thank this questionnaire was alright and well in it place some thing good to give a souldier right to speak his thought about the war. i like it my self,black,0
3036,,,"it has been and is being noticed that the service clubs, day rooms, and other theaters of the white camps are much better than the same for colored. why is this so? is it not true that both colors are fighting for the same cause. is the white soldier risking more than the negro soldier? then why aren't they offered the same facilities for amusement? the negro soldier will fight to the best of his ability for this great cause but in doing the same, white soldiers are given twice as much credit. why is this so? will these conditions be changed as the war progresses?",black,3
3037,,,i am in the unite state . i got  right and fight in the  the white man. it is some of  to fight in the army. but that is a unit state we have sister and children  we must fight for them.,black,1
3038,,,when we got to town and get burnt then we catch hell behind it so why can't we be like other people up north a little ways they don't care so very much but why did they have to send us northern races boys down south and the southern raise north if we stay near our home town then we can see our people once in a while but to bring them almost clear across the earth then we have double expense and we can't feel right behind all of this but we have to leave our love ones to suffer and we can't do nothing about it comments about the questionnaire,black,0
3039,,,a talk with the president it would be  very interesting   to see and talk to the president. i will ask him many questions about the war and my home farm. it looks as if food is getting short and something be done.i thing i can do good  here and at home.,black,0
3040,,,i think the questions asked are o.k. but under certain circumstances some of them are a bit hard for me to answer because haven't been here long enough.,black,0
3041,,,"the getting along of the white and the negro seem to slow the progress of history for in civilian life, if the negro was given the right job he would be able to do as the white are doing and that is he will be able to ""buy bonds"" as he wish then at the close of the war they can say ""we have done our share."" the negro is doing as much as he can now but he wish to do more and he can but if given a sufficient job to do so. in many cases the white will not permit the negro to have big jobs in order to help the war effort and educate his children as he wish. what this country need is education and only the white get so much as they want. the negro want it but can't get it. i hope after the war things will be better for the negro. my idea is the white and negro should be the same.",black,11
3042,,,i like the questionnaire will but all have to say is don't like diss place i am i would rather go with because you will  to like the army because down south a negro have hard time.,black,1
3043,,,why did war have be started before they coul to talking about the different rights for the negro. will it lost a lony & the war or when the war is over it the same old way. why shouldn't't i done been this way lony beful.,black,0
3044,,,i can't understand why it aint any colored mp in the south and it is as many colored mp in the north as it is white i think it should bee in the sowt also. why not,black,0
3045,,,i am not being treated fair. they don't allow me to explain myself about anything i do. they won't let you speak your opinions. when i came in 2 yrs ago i thought i could get by with one year and i haven't had but 1 furlough in 2 yrs.,black,0
3046,,,"too many stool-pidgeons in my company have been in army two years & do not go out of camp due to the fact that too many casualties are suffered at the hands of the mp service clubs change too much for food. has been in the army two years & would not mind staying in if i could be close to home, at distance of about four-hundred miles. slip jim-crow methods in buses & all carriers. too much company restrictions not enough 3 day leaves of absence for men who could profit by them.",black,0
3047,,,sure hope this does some good,black,0
3048,,,should the colored have the same show that the white have in camp why they dont s dont see the reason and  like the white have a better chance then the colored have any way in the south because the colored cant hardly get a pass to town and s dont see why,black,6
3049,,,the buses dont have convient places for a negro soldier to ride on. the mp beat up soldiers in town with out cause. you have to stand in line so long to catch a bus.,black,0
3050,,,just want to say something about the bus. i think that we are not trusted right at all down here because we have to sit on the back of the buses and when there a lot of white people they will not even let the colored people get on. i have went to get a bus and for the the same reason above i had to mis 207 3 bus and i don't think that is right. another thing is why do they have to send all the boy from the north down south. the boys from the north are not use to the white people treating them like dogs. i think that is why the colored people don't get along down here.,black,4
3051,,,"it doesn't make much different about negro having the same px and same clubs, but it do make difference when they are not being treated alike.",black,1
3052,,,the average southern white man has no respect for a negro soldier. no other country in all the world would permit its soldiers to be treated the way the negro soldier in the south is treated by the southern white man.,black,5
3053,,,the questionnaire is a fine thing if it mean any thing to help the negro & white.,black,2
3054,,,if the war last as much as a year longer i had rather be over sea or in prison than in the camp i am in now. negro officers get little respect from white troops in southern camps. the white mps taken sides with white civillians when negro are involved. the bus service is terrible for white troops.,black,7
3055,,,i do think in my opinion that this survey is remarkable because it gives each soldier a chance to express himself when the time comes they will know how each individual feels and his honest opinion and whats gong on in his mind.,black,0
3056,,,1. this problem can never be solved until every man completely relys wholly upon our blessed land and the way of lasting peace.  2. why  white people and ? we have negro who ought to be in special service branches.,black,1
3057,,,"""why are these questions asked?""",black,0
3058,,,the reason i always will say that a negro soldier should be in the north as for this reason he can go to place where his reaputed. here in the south there is only one place for a negro soldier that being where all of the cutthroats of the city survive at. now if it could be possible aranged for our . that all negro who and when they do go north would get into this armsantity i would make them be better solder. they say  . with it you would take them to  where their are large northern cities they could  in his classes of which would do him more good than him.  this  send them north,black,3
3059,,,"the federal government should see that protection from whites in the south are given negro soldiers. the custom on locating negro camps near cheap, small, rural southern towns should be discontinued. segregation on trains in the south should be discontinued. if it works in the north, it will work in the south.  there should be polical changes in the south through federal legislation. how can a negro soldier fight pleased knowing that when he returns home he will deprived of his rights in the south and many places in the north.  why don't you people in washington and elsewhere wake up, and if this country is to be a democracy, let's make it a democracy!!!",black,5

3074,,,"pertaining to bus service: the bus service from the nearest town to camp is very rotten, and colored soldiers have a lot of difficulty trying to get to camp. to my knowledge, i think that after this war, i have a feeling as though russia might attack the united states although i may be wrong.",black,0
3075,,,"we don't think we should mingle so much with white southern soldiers but i do think there should be better arrangements made for our transportation to and from town from this camp. why don't we have colored officers here in our company (commissioned). why do they send us northern soldiers to southern camps when we have camps in northern states. & my one & greatest statement is that, if citizens of the u.s. would kindly drop this follishness of discrimination and let everyone live as god intended & all so as the constitution of the u.s. says, ""every man is created equally."" this statement in in the constitution of the u.s but i really cannot see where it is being practiced. when it is practiced & all other races live & abide live it, we as a whole will have a much better nation.",black,3

3082,,,"i think that this is a very wise movement. it gives the soldier a chance to express his opinion about different difficulties that so often rises in camps. i hope that the negro voice will after this war be given a fair chance, not limited to the dirty jobs, not restricted from voting, no color lines drawn which is to he the barrier that separate him and help him from reaping the for which he gave his life, tears, blood and tail so gallantly so. we love this u.s. and all that it stands for, we'll fight to the finish.",black,0
3083,,,"(1.) i know the majority of negro soldiers would rather be across in their zones than to under go things that they are now under going in southern camps.

3084,,,the negro has proven himself beyond any reasonable doubt if given an opportunity he will excell in everything.  the southern camp i have been a victim of one has done more to break down the morale of colored troops than anything that hitler or any axis power could possible do.  to me these southern camps as a whoole are a help to the enemy instead of these u.s. i am 100% an american and proud of the fact as long as i stay up north.  i can truthfully say i am expressing the thoughts of the fourty eight men that came with me.  it happens to be my first experience south. & god knows i hope my last.,black,1

3103,,,some of the thing in this questionnaire are right and some of them were not all right. because the white people do not give a color man for a soldier a chance each them with and forget all about them.,black,2

3194,,,i dont think that the proper questions were put in this questionnnare it is a dirty shame the way a colored soldier is treated in the southern camps. there are signs all over this camp saying for white only transportation is poor yet they dont want colored cab drivers on the post the few that can come are so far behind you don't know they are there. the policy on this post is that the white soldiers dont have to salute the few colored officers who are here - a colored officer on this post is treated with no more respect than an enlisted man. recently a number of new thirties were built on this post only one was for colored troops it seats 400 the others were for white they seat 1200 my personal opinion of this camp is it should be saturated with gas and burnt.,black,8
3195,,,"most southern white officers think that they are far superior to the negro and that no negro is good enough to be half way on equal basis. so therefore the negro is shunted into the worst localities, the worst jobs, and the outfits or kind of work where he is seldom heard of and never gets any praise or glory. then our percentage of buses according to percentage of negro soldiers is way low. also in a negro outfit there is no system of transportation at all.

3229,,,"army camps i think it is better to have a soldier from the north or east or south or west should be trained in his own section of the country because he knows most of the country and understand the ways of his officers, that is, if the officer is from his section of the country. i also believe that if a soldier was allowed more privileges, that is to speak what he thinks and the fellows or officers or non coms over him did not't try to be too much of a hard boiled soldier, the camps would be a great deal better. a soldier should be allowed to visit his people at least once ever two months for at least a weak or ten days, then he would not worry so much about his home folks and could consentrate on his work more better.",black,0

3232,,,"concerning the question ""are you ever worried or upbeat,"" i would like to say that i am, due to having to live in an atmosphere wholly foreign to the one i have lived in for forty-five years. it is a mockery to be told that one is fighting for democracy when one has to suffer undemocratic treatment as a soldier. what sustains me is a faith in the idealistic intentions of our president.  i think the negro is doing more than his share to help win the war because he is given most of the dirty jobs regardless of individual fitness for other kinds of work.",black,1
3233,,,after this war is over we all expect to live peacably here together. given a fair chance the negro is not a hard fellow to get along with. if getting along in common isn't practice it will never become perfect. there is quite a bit one can learn from the other.,black,1
3234,,,i am a man that was born in the south have learn and seen them i been to the north and seeing thing the rights that people hve. then i came to the amry went to the north and south still people in the north still have this right. and people i the south don't have this right the white in the south both in ad out of the army do people the same. office from the north get with office of the south and do the same then i think of the  worlds where people will start the same thing one of the days it may be soon or lated but as far as the way go i do my part more if i can,black,0

3242,,,we don't have a chance to go to town to have pleasure. and dont have very much entertainment on the post.  i also think the negro back home should try to make things better for us after the war.  i am being treated very well here but i would rather be in the north i would be treated better.  i think it will be better after this war than world war i -  jobs should be provided for ex soldier after this war by some means and wages be a better price than the other.,black,0

3246,,,we dont have a chance to take a bath we have to work one sunday the officers tells the non commissioned officers to keep us busy at all times they want give us any passes. we dont have chances to play games like the white soldiers do. they will not see to us getting enough to eat. they make us get up at 12 oclock at night when we should be aslept. the officers curses after us at all times. colored are not treated fair. the officers will not give us a three day pass. that is one reason so many tries to run away from the army if negro was treated right would try to do better.,black,2
3247,,,"only one or two question if the  negro don't get a break now they never will. we got to have a fair chance. we are looking for it. we of negro race have been catching hell. we must have our freedom of speech. we got to live to together so why not we be treated right here in this camp? we go on a drill field they put us to the back of the field. we are tired of that shit. why not we be on the front some times? we are humans, we are flesh, we are blood yet we be drafted in the army isn't fair hell no!",black,0

3252,,,we all are in this army. negro do not know while should be fighting. they have not did any thing to any body across the sea while should they go across to fight for the country it is not the negro country it is the white mans country not the negro.  in the south most negro are slaves if they dont have any ibality they are in a bad condition. now while they be taken from their homes to be kill are kill. i dont thank that is a fair deal i hope before the war is over they will be on a equal share,black,7
