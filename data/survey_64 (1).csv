As far as being fine gentlemen they are all right, but many are not able to lead in the field, but would be better suited in plans and operations, etc., or anything like that. A soldier can't be disciplined, which is the main cog in any army, by an officer that he feels is not capable of leading him when he does get into the real thing. There is too much passing the buck down to non-commissioned from the officers because of the simple reason that they can't carry on themselves. A lot of the training is unnecessary. I believe that it states in field manual 20-5 that men should not be overtaxed or fatigued without cause. When it is found out who can take it this should stop. We have found out. 50% have been discharged which it too many. We now can take it when we get into combat, but we don't need any more practice. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,

Then as a result they try to show off and drive the men around like a bunch of dogs. The average man don't like that and it often leads to such things as AWOL and desertions and striking an officer. In some cases the man who has,committed the offence is quite justified in his actions. But as I said there are some higher-ups that don't give a hoot about the man in the low ranks & as a result the officer or non-com doesn't get a thing done to him. But the man who has committed the offence gets the book & everything in it piled on him. As a result more trouble. If there is any thing that the average man despises most it's the guy who's always trying to pull his rank on some body. I've seen it happen more than once & I can truthfully say I don't like it a little bit. And then there's the guy who polishes the C.O's shoes just to get another stripe.

They gig us for our barracks while theirs are far dirtier and much more disorderly than ours. I have saw that the case more than once. An officer when he is among other people considers himself above enlisted men while the majority of service men think all men should be equally based there. In the long run there is good reason for most of this. We are not given as much amusement & excitement as we would like to have. We appreciate the many privileges we are given on such thing as discounts at PX and free mail. Some men growl but when it comes down to the real thing they see different.

I am slightly worried about him because he has been getting sick lately and there is no one to take care of him when he does get sick. The cause of no one taking care of him when he is sick is because he isnt married and my brothers and sister do not go and see him at any time.

It seems about 400 of us old men (1 yr or more training) were sent here in Cadre but instead of using us to win this war we were put in a new outfit on diferent guns and mixed in with recruits and have started basic training again. We take orders from 3 mos. sgts. The 400 men are very low in morale and most of us who are non coms are being broke because of lack of interest. It seems they have destroyed 400 great soldiers instead of using us for the war efort. We all were conected with an Alert Btry on the east coast for over 2 years before coming here with no furloughs and very few passes protecting eastern coast defenses. We were thoroughly trained on 90 milimeter guns and 155 mm. and after all that training and schooling we got at the beginning of our army career we are put on 40 mm. which we know nothing about and are darn sure are not more important than the two other guns we spent our army life with.

However in my own company I have noticed something that has turned my liking of army life to hate or a don't care attitude. Our company was formed of a group of volunteers from the state of West Virginia which of course is something to be proud of. When they enlisted they were given ratings. This group of men were not,"enough in number to complete a whole company or of course others were taken in. These others that I speak of were from different parts of the United States & of course resented the fact that others were given authority above them, when they were older army men. My own example is I think an average of what these men had to put up with. I was trained in Cadre & was considered a fairly good soldier, yet these enlisted men were not going to put a stranger above their friends & they have just taken over the company. If we were a group of common labourers all men of low intelligence I think that they would be justified in doing what they have done. I do as much if not more work than any of them yet I have not the slightest chance or hope of ever making an advancement. We do all the dirty work & extra details that the company has I have done bull labor since I have been in the company. Even if we don't get any ratings I think that we should get as much chance for making better wages because it takes all of us to make a group function to a satisfactory degree.
