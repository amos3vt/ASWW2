I dont think the army should take a man away from his boy that his mother left when he was 3 yrs old and have some single men home laughing at the boys in service. I personal believe war is the wrong thing to have but some people dont care who they hurt. For my part I would rather be home working in war plants & taken care of my boy. for my father is sick & under doctor care & my mother has heart trouble & don't know how much longer she will last, also under Doctor Care. My boy is 6 years & lives with my Mother & Father & I was hurt in Auto wrecks & had my head knock around & my back hurt. But if this is the place for me & if I can help out. May the Lord Bless us & watch over us Day & night [underline] Untill We Meet Again our love one Some Sunny Day.[underline]"

In general an officer is envied until he's proven himself worth of his rank -- then, and only then, d0es he receive the respect of all his men. Many enlisted men have a greater sense of responsibility than the same percentage of officers. A respected officer -- and I've been under four -- can have my cooperation in everything, I don't care what it is."

Because someone wants to make a good name for himself why charge $78.00 a year to a man. I have no dependents so why make me take it. I can use that money to better advantages. I don't like the way the policy is paid or paid off either. In my opinion, it's not a good policy. Because an officer tells me it is I don't have to believe him. What person could live on 54.00 a month. I have 3000 in civilian insurance, no dependents, I could have a hell of a funeral. I'm not going to be here to enjoy it. When I get married if I do, I'll take out insurance. What if it does cost me more thats my business not the Army's. Any statement they could make as to why I should have 10,000 NSL, I can give you my reason why I shouldn't. What the hell is this war for but to protect the American Way and that also means the right to take or not to take as much insurance as you want. The chow since 3/1/43 is P Poor.

[paragraph] Not having a furlough in the 9 month I spent in the army generally would make a soldier gripe. I think each  soldiers should be given a furlough after serving that much time in the service. I feel that the single men in our squadron should have just as much right to be allowed to go in town while not on duty. The married men with wives living in town are the only ones entitled to class A pass while as the other hand some of us single fellows have earned class A basses by good grades in school but the squadron will not issue passes to us. It seems a married man has more privileges.

The morale is lower in this camp than any place I have ever seen. We all know we have a hard job to make soldiers in a short time but the officers don't have to cuss the men out and refuse to give us plenty of water during hot weather. From 4:45 AM until 5:30 PM is too many hours for what we have to do in basic training. The location of Sheppard Field is bad enough with making it worse by not running the camp the best way possible.

Especially these ""90 day wonders"" who have been in the Army about 3 or 4 months longer that we have and act as if they were ""Generals"". I believe a fellow in the Army would do a better job is he were in an outfit he choosed [chose] to be in. When a fellow comes in the Army he should be given a chance to choose his branch of the service. I think a newly drafted soldier should receive a 10-15 day furlough as soon as his Basic is over. The furlough system in the Army should pattern after the Navy. Some of the officers are to ready to dish out punishment for trivial things that don't amount to a dam. Sgts shouldn't be allowed to hand out company punishment until it has gone thru the proper hands. To much of a soldiers spare or off duty hours are taken up by things that should be put in the days schedule. Pvts and Pfc shouldn't have as much authority over men in their company.

This being kicked around & dog robbing [running errands for officers] for every outfit in the army is very disgusting if you don't believe it try it some time.,,,,,We came back to the states from the Alcan Highway in March too sit on a furlough & returned then we have been kicked around so much that every one of the four truck cadres are ready to do most any thing except what they should do. We had a good bunch to start with but I wouldn't say so much for us now. Some one has evidently made an error & no one wants to take the blame for it. It doesn't stand to reason that they can have 28 men lay around this way that is just a waste of the money spent on War bonds. At least it's no encouragement for buying more.[paragraph] We would all like to see something happen. This being kicked around & dog robbing [running errands for officers] for every outfit in the army is very disgusting if you don't believe it try it some time.

So you destroy gov [government] property want only to get sizes. A waste and bad for Army and morale. Hotels will not give rooms even to a sober soldier. All judge by a few. Food could be better. One part of [unclear] fort [/unclear] loves good. Other doesn't. All rations should be equal. Film education should be 1943 technique not 1918. Southern public 'sticks' you. Civil war attitude towards Northerners. All should be together now. Gas rationing should be same all over. West is very lax. And they wont give rides no matter if you are spic and span. Army could place men more carefully in my case. Radio in medics. If I can provide for family & stay in business in civil life as a radio man. Should be able to do some good in the army- was classified 373. Do know one thing and that is when we come home we are going to see to it that things are right and just.

Service Club on post are not called for fellow want to get away from camp and not be stuck on some army camps all the time. alot of food could be a lot better. ,,,,,I feel this way if a soldier is married and is not in a heathy condition he should be out of the army and a lot of boys on the out side who are running around should be in service. Reasons for A.W.O.L. is that a soldier is not treated like a human being. Some people don't want them around. their homes they feel if a soldier drinks he is just a bum. A soldier that is married and has a family should be out of the service and taking the young fellow in who are young and active and not boys who have bad physical conditions. Service Club on post are not called for fellow want to get away from camp and not be stuck on some army camps all the time. alot of food could be a lot better.

We were first promised a 3 day leave after our first 8 weeks of training. That was cancelled and we were promised a furlough after one basic training and that was called off. We have also been promised several weekend passes and have not received them and it doesn't help a fellows [fellow's] morale to have promise after promise broken especially when it concerns a chance to see your folks once. None of us know exactly when we'll be called for real duty and we are all itching for a chance to get home once before we do go across.

Too, I am not very much interested in the armored force. The camp here at Ft. Knox is swell and the officers are fine. My thoughts are higher, up into the sky.

It would seem to me that a man with two years of college, a man who holds a shipfitters helper rating in Civil Service employed in [unclear] [/unclear] battle repair in the Navy Yards, or who is qualified through past experience and education to grasp any type of defense job, would do much better in a war essential civilian job than in a non essential Limited Service Army Job. Is it any wonder the Limited Service morale is low, they must all feel in part the way I do. I am looking forward hopefully to this form 161 in hopes that I may get out of the service and get into an occupation that will benefit me."
