0,"Negroes have been told many times they're fighting this war so that they may have Democracy and the same rights and privileges as whites. But a colored soldier is more discriminated against and segregated than he was when he was a civilian. Its evident to those who care to see it that not many of the promises to Negroes are being kept. Since the Emancipation Proclamation Negroes have been fighting for what they have now. Each right, each privilege was fought for. Whatever conclusions may be drawn from this survey lets hope its for the further advantage of the Negroes. Negroes love America and will fight for America but the Negroes are going to demand a status as a citizen equal to that of a white citizen. Only that way can an example of Democracy be used for other countries.",I think the negro soldier should have the same chance the white soldier have because we all are soldiers.

Another white man was passing in a truck saw it stops, came in with a iron bar and began beating the soldier.

The conditions under which the negro soldier is laboring not only corroborates the fact that he is doing more than his share, but makes him stand out as a superhuman. Funny, the potential strength of this nation could exceed itself by such a margin, If ? a house divided cannot stand and will not stand. I dare say the Economic, Political and Social status of this nation would be greatly affect by this recognition. Are we really feared?

They must be cleared up before this war can be won: soldiers must be placed in the armed forces where they are best fitted; segregation and racial discrimination must be abolished; soldiers must be treated as human beings - not as cattle and beasts of burden; the policy of ""military politics"" whereby promotions + other favors are granted in friendship rather than on ability should be discontinued; and many other defects of equal importance need to be remedied without unnecessary delay.

As long as officers discriminate against Negro enlisted men because the enlisted men have more education and more following with the men below them then the war will be harder to win.

As long as there are officers who bulldoze men for the simple reason that they are Negroes and not white there can only be discontent int he ranks even though this discontent is not shown to the officer for fear of being charged with insubordination. As long as there are officers who think Hitler is right and that all Jews should be dead then there will be no leadership at the time when it is needed. As long as officers discriminate against Negro enlisted men because the enlisted men have more education and more following with the men below them then the war will be harder to win.

More time is usually diverted to how we are treated than to our regular work and what we are in the army for. Much more cooperation could be obtained from Colored Northern soldiers if they were stationed somewhere in the north instead of the south. Another fault is the use of Southern white officers over a group of northern colored soldiers. They usually don't understand our emotions and never think that we have the same will power and brain power as they. They think we are not capable of being officers and treat our colored second lieutenants thus. Many white officers of the same grade have come to our outfit during the same time as colored officers. They are now first lieutenants and don't know as much in most cases as the Colored officers. Is that equality? especially so evident in a colored outfit.

It is impossible to understand how the brains of the Southern white man works and just what can be the cause of so much enmity and hate that is imposed upon the Negro soldier. With all the patriotic speeches and supposedly war effort he takes time out to heap insults and abuse upon the Negro soldier who is doing all that he can to further the war effort. This energy could be well used to further the defeat of the enemy. To my mind most Southern white people must fear that the rise of the Negro will be of danger to their long vaunted White Supremacy. There can be no other reason for such stupid treatment of a fellow American. Stupidity as we all know breeds ""fear"". (over)",It has been very difficult to answer all questions faily.

618,"The white O.C.S. graduates at this station are notably given preference over the negro in promotions, regardless to ability to lead and knowledge of weapons and tactics. This in my opinion is a serious mistake and may cause uncessary loss of life. They are pushing white men into jobs to large for them rather than promote a negro to the grade of captain or higher. It shows that our higher ranking officers are allowing prejudice and discrimination to influence their decisions. Such officers should not be given command of negro troops. Such weakness in commanders may well result in defeat of an entire army. Care must be taken in chooseing commanders fro negro troops.","The status of the Negro after the war will depend largely what part he is allowed to play in the winning of the war. Many are capable and many are not. But as long as Negro troops are manned by white officers who believe that no Negro is good enough to make an officer then he should naturally believe that no Negro is competent to make a good soldier. As long as there are officers who bulldoze men for the simple reason that they are Negroes and not white there can only be discontent int he ranks even though this discontent is not shown to the officer for fear of being charged with insubordination. As long as there are officers who think Hitler is right and that all Jews should be dead then there will be no leadership at the time when it is needed. As long as officers discriminate against Negro enlisted men because the enlisted men have more education and more following with the men below them then the war will be harder to win. The Negro wants to do his part but when he is confronted with such things he loses heart. When he sees enlisted men more qualified for leadership than officers, and these enlisted men denied opportunity and even afraid to apply for OCS [Officer Candidate School] because of fear of what they have attained if they are not accepted - then the Negro will have a tough time in being a good soldier. When you have white civilians in the south shooting, beating & abusing Negro soldiers; and in camps the same thing is going on the Negro - even though he has the ability, loses much desire to fight. He fights only on hope that the future will have more in store.",0.7541557550430298

From the way the lectures and critiques are broken down in a kindergarten form I am inclined to disagree with that theory. Glaring examples of this mistaken belief can be seen around here any day. ","The Army should have better regulation for company's rulings. There are too many different ones giving orders in my company. There should be more instruction from the ones in charge and less orders, which could be obeyed better.

All quarter master training centers should have negro officers, because we can get along better with negro officers than we do now with white ones. ",0.718197226524353

That didnt give me much courage to want to fight. If I thought the white people would give the colored people living a square deal I would gladly die for the cause. But I know they wont.

I would like to know what they are thinking about to make such a remark. Color does not make the man. Every one is created free and equal. Man is a living soul.

As long as officers discriminate against Negro enlisted men because the enlisted men have more education and more following with the men below them then the war will be harder to win.

I do hope what I've said will be of some help in bettering the existing conditions of the Army & may it be a help to me in getting into appreciated branch of service. There I feel I would mean more to the army as a whole. Thanks for a chance to express a part of my opinion.,When I came into the army I wanted to go into the ground crew of the Air Force as a mechanic. I have had training in school for it and liked it.

1024,"Here in this camp, I've heard where the negro officer could only be rated up to a 1st Lt. Therefore closing the door of advancement by things like this doesn't give a young man the feeling of doing more than he could if there was a chance of advancement. Also some of these southern Lts. try & dog us, and by some coming from the north, it really gets under their skin & anything is liable to occur. ","I myself think that especially the negro soldiers would been better benefited and trained to defend the U.S. if their non.com were selected carefully and the com. officers would at all times dwell in their heads that first, we're negroes and were here because we're training to defend America, mostly belong to them, and we're already unsatisiied, and on top of that, some of them tries to dog us around like dogs, that in time is going to cause war in camps. I feel like even in war a man should be given the place he says to be place, if fitted, there he will find satisfying service. The non.com and comm. officers should be check regular to see if they are treating the soldiers as brothers. The soldiers should not from there pay be made deduct so much for difference things. The soldier as individuals have these trade and ideas, and should be given the chance to put them to practice as far as possible.

If the negro was inducted into the Army for labor only and not combat duty, many of the present ordeals presented him could be overlooked. But he is expected to give his life if necessary in helping to win this war. Not that mixed association is asked by the negro soldier, but the ever reminding signs that are placed on many buildings in Army Post causes resentment from the negro soldier. It can not be over looked that the negro is being educated and being able to see what is happening in various sections of this country, a thought remains constant in his mind as to whether or not he is fighting for his benefit or for the continuance of white supremacy.",0.7538936138153076

1188,1. The white papers seldom give the negro soldiers any write up or what they do. The only way is to read our colored papers to find out different things. 2. A colored person is willing to do his or her share but in some cases they turn thumbs down on them. 3. Speaking of seporation between the white & colored is that every one may not get along peacefully. And the white soldiers & colored would not like the idea very much. 4. In many cases in the south a colored soldier is either killed or very badly beaten by the town police and nothing is every done about it. That shows how much he is appreciated in the service.,About the only comment I have to make is that I really and truly do not think negro soldiers are treated as just as could be. It never appears in white papers but in old negro publications it can be learned about the unjust treatment we have to go through. Both in garrison and in combat.

This proves to be quite an ordeal & presents the following problems: If the Negro's blood is good enough to be spilled on foreign land why is he not good enough to sit where he chooses?

1718,"I dislike discrimination between colored and white soldiers on the part of the army. To win this war will take cooperation and color will have to be forgotten. The reason the other side is so far ahead of this country is because the southern white man goes out of his way to keep the colored man down. The southern white people seem as if they are not fighting any foreign country, but are fighting to keep the negro from advancing above his present level. When a colored officer is stationed in the south, white soldiers and officers turn their back to keep from saluting him. Most negro officers are stationed in the north or on the west coast. White southerners would treat a yard dog better than they do a negro. Roland Hays of Ga. was terribly beaten because his wife refused to buy a pair of shoes. A southern white man wants you to kiss his ass to get along with him, but yet he wants you to fight to keep him in luxury. Gov. Talmadge of Georgia said over the radio that he would rather see Germany & Japan rule the world rather than see a negro sit down beside him on a bus. The white people of Texarkana cut a negros nuts and made him eat them because he was suspected of raping a white girl.

1761,"If I could get out this man army I would get out to-day. I am losing my health and can't get the medical treatments like I want to. Whites are treated better in hospital than colored. I have never seen a hospital where the patients have to do porter work. When southern troops are brought north they try to bring the south there. Theaters, PXs, Service Clubs are Jim Crowed. There is not service activities for the colored man in most camps that I have been to. Jim Crow in the U.S.O such places should be abolished. Restaurants are Jim Crowed in the towns. When there is a parade in town there hardly ever is a colored outfit in them. I don't give a damn for such things but its the principal [principle] and the respect that we getting while the war is going on what is there to expect when it is over. The white soldiers are always getting passes. Segration on train buses and etc. I am fed up with the whole damn thing. ","I don't see any reason when the white and colored soldier are in the same hospital, why the white soldier always has t he first preference to eating. If they wanted to treat all soldiers equally, let one eat first one day and the other the next day. Many cases, soldiers are really sick and made to go out in the field anyway, which puts them in a worse condition than they would have been otherwise.

My personal opinion about Mississippi is let the enemy come and bomb the hell out of it and it would be better than before. That incident happened in Texas some few months ago.

But if a Negro is segregated, Jim Crowed and generally mis-treated he cannot maintain the spirit necessary to do his part and he adapts the ""don't care-what difference does it make"" attitude. Since this war is being fought, as we are told, for freedom of the races, why can't we start at home and give the Negro absolute freedom, the chance to live and work on an equal footing with the whites? Why can't Negro men who wear the uniform of the U.S. be protected from insults, beatings, and social & racial discrimination both at home and abroad? Why can't the Negro be given the chance to fight in all branches of the services instead of having to do all the work? Give us the assurance that we, as soldiers, and our families at home will be given full freedom and protection from these evils and full cooperation in all branches of the service then watch us go.

Married men with two or more children that is already should be let out to work in war plants. He will not make a good soldier he only think of his family at home instead of what the army is trying to teach him, the Army is wasting time and money trying too trained him. A married man with children would be of more service too his country at home working in a war plant then in the army as a soldier",0.7066932320594788

With knowledge of pedijuce [prejudice] in the country he is reluctant to talk to white officer. He is in constant fear of not being given the right concideration. Therefore goes on only half hearted in his duties. To show reason at the present time that all negros will be given equal rights and recognition in economic and cival condition will change the attitude of the negro soldier and make him a real player in the combat team.

Jim Crowism should be wiped out.

To win this war will take cooperation and color will have to be forgotten. The reason the other side is so far ahead of this country is because the southern white man goes out of his way to keep the colored man down. The southern white people seem as if they are not fighting any foreign country, but are fighting to keep the negro from advancing above his present level. When a colored officer is stationed in the south, white soldiers and officers turn their back to keep from saluting him. Most negro officers are stationed in the north or on the west coast. White southerners would treat a yard dog better than they do a negro. Roland Hays of Ga. was terribly beaten because his wife refused to buy a pair of shoes.

The transportation around this camp is entirely too slow. It takes a soldier half the night nearly to get out of camp and sometimes he may be going to town to shop. When he gets there everything is closed. The fact they brought out about the Negro living conditions after the war was a good question. I hope it is better.

Transportation to town here for soldiers has been very poor until last saturday when they made up their minds to take the soldiers to town and bring them back.

These officers do no do that they have their wives or girl friends close at hand. The way we are treated here a good man or a man that has a clean record through life would do things he would not do if he had certain privileges.

If the army officials keep sending northern soldiers south there will always be that bitter feeling between the two Colored Northerners and White Southerners. More time is usually diverted to how we are treated than to our regular work and what we are in the army for. Much more cooperation could be obtained from Colored Northern soldiers if they were stationed somewhere in the north instead of the south. Another fault is the use of Southern white officers over a group of northern colored soldiers. They usually don't understand our emotions and never think that we have the same will power and brain power as they. They think we are not capable of being officers and treat our colored second lieutenants thus. Many white officers of the same grade have come to our outfit during the same time as colored officers.

The transportation around this camp is entirely too slow. It takes a soldier half the night nearly to get out of camp and sometimes he may be going to town to shop. When he gets there everything is closed. The fact they brought out about the Negro living conditions after the war was a good question. I hope it is better.

2633,Why does one have to be station so far from home when there are so many camps near his home? The treatment in all of the camps that I have been in has been unfair most of the time so far as colored soldiers are concerned but some of this could be overlooked if one was not so far from home.,The Negro soldier should be placed in camps situated in their part of the country mainly because they are use to the customs of that part of the country. If the army officials keep sending northern soldiers south there will always be that bitter feeling between the two Colored Northerners and White Southerners. More time is usually diverted to how we are treated than to our regular work and what we are in the army for. Much more cooperation could be obtained from Colored Northern soldiers if they were stationed somewhere in the north instead of the south. Another fault is the use of Southern white officers over a group of northern colored soldiers. They usually don't understand our emotions and never think that we have the same will power and brain power as they. They think we are not capable of being officers and treat our colored second lieutenants thus. Many white officers of the same grade have come to our outfit during the same time as colored officers. They are now first lieutenants and don't know as much in most cases as the Colored officers. Is that equality? especially so evident in a colored outfit. Everyone has noticed it.,0.7692430019378662

2638,This questionnaire should have more space for a soldier to express his own opinion and not so many ready made answers. As they dont always express his ideas toward a certain question. As you have seen that I often had to write in the space along side of the question in order to express my own opinion. Otherwise the questionnaire isnt a very bad one. And I think it should be passed out at certain times through the years as ones opinions often change. ,"Most of these questions call for more than a ""yes"" of a ""no,"" and whenever allowed, the write has made comments.

None of them can be revealed with the scope of these monosyllabic answers called for here. But we trust that these unsolved problems are being brought to the attention of the War Department by other methods beyond this superficial survey. They must be cleared up before this war can be won: soldiers must be placed in the armed forces where they are best fitted; segregation and racial discrimination must be abolished; soldiers must be treated as human beings - not as cattle and beasts of burden; the policy of ""military politics"" whereby promotions + other favors are granted in friendship rather than on ability should be discontinued; and many other defects of equal importance need to be remedied without unnecessary delay.

Many are capable and many are not. But as long as Negro troops are manned by white officers who believe that no Negro is good enough to make an officer then he should naturally believe that no Negro is competent to make a good soldier. As long as there are officers who bulldoze men for the simple reason that they are Negroes and not white there can only be discontent int he ranks even though this discontent is not shown to the officer for fear of being charged with insubordination. As long as there are officers who think Hitler is right and that all Jews should be dead then there will be no leadership at the time when it is needed. As long as officers discriminate against Negro enlisted men because the enlisted men have more education and more following with the men below them then the war will be harder to win. The Negro wants to do his part but when he is confronted with such things he loses heart. When he sees enlisted men more qualified for leadership than officers, and these enlisted men denied opportunity and even afraid to apply for OCS [Officer Candidate School] because of fear of what they have attained if they are not accepted - then the Negro will have a tough time in being a good soldier.

2875,This questionnaire is a very good idea it gives me a chance to speak my open mind. Transportation to town here for soldiers has been very poor until last saturday when they made up their minds to take the soldiers to town and bring them back. Treatment here of the negro soldier is bad. Where do they get the idea from that a soldier can be kept away from his wife or mother and family for 6 or 8 months and do not want to give him a furlough to go home. These officers do no do that they have their wives or girl friends close at hand. The way we are treated here a good man or a man that has a clean record through life would do things he would not do if he had certain privileges. I am a soldier and have a clean record not only in the army but also through life but if they do not give me a chance to see my intended wife and mother soon I will have to resort to other measures.,These questions that I have just answered has just about covered everything. A few main points i would like to bring out is the fact that the Mo's are a bit too harsh on soldiers. The transportation around this camp is entirely too slow. It takes a soldier half the night nearly to get out of camp and sometimes he may be going to town to shop. When he gets there everything is closed. The fact they brought out about the Negro living conditions after the war was a good question. I hope it is better. A lot of the Negros feel that they do not have anything to give their life for. When a man fights for something I think he is entitled to it.,0.7947758436203003

But unless that there will always be forcing, which is no advancement in their particular unit in which they are connected with. Our Negro soldiers can make good soldiers and will under certain conditions. In my conclusion, it may be years or centuries but all men will be an equality.
