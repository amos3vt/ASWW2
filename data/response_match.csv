"The part I would like to discuss is the conditions of this camp for basic training. I came in this camp at the start of the rainy season (Oct[October]) It rained all through my basic. When we were firing on the range for record, it rained and it was also very cold. It is my idea that under these conditions a soldier does not benefit as much from his training as he would in a more suitable climate. When he is wet and cold most of the time he can't concentrate on the problem at hand, therefore he doesn't gain much from his basic.
